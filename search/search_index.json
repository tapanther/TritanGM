Where the Shroud provides the initial energy to the weapon, it is the Demon Core that empowers the truly apocalyptic devastation the weapon wreaks. The Demon Core, like all pieces of the weapon, was separated and hidden by Hermes Trismegistus prior to the Great Sack. Unbeknownst to anyone outside Hermes' inner circle, the Demon Core was not buried in a desolate area, but was instead entrusted into the care of Lord Symnyr Lynch, Councillor of Blackpoint and a long-time personal friend. As prolongued exposure to the Core is extremely hazardous, the sphere was placed inside a leaden sarcophagus, and hidden deep within the catacombs under the city. Since then, the existence of the Demon Core and its final resting place has been a closely guarded secret, known only to the office of the Blackpoint Councillor, and after the Great Sack, the Royal Chancellor that superseded the title. Discovering the location of the Demon Core's sarcophagus is no easy task. The catacombs are a twisting maze of passages and chambers, many of which have not been accessed in centuries. Many of the catacomb entrances were sealed during the Great Sack, and the rest are heavily guarded by the Dusk Templars. Breaking into the catacombs will be a difficult proposition, second only to breaking out with the sarcophagus. Alternatively, a diplomatic approach may be possible. The current Chancellor, Lord Reynfred, has been searching for information about the weapon, as have his predecessors. Although the Chancellor would use the weapon for his own purposes, the Lynch family remains the unofficial protectors of the Demon Core. Yrvyn Lynch serves as the Chancellor's clerk, has access to his ancestor's records, and has been looking for a way to secure the Demon Core from the Chancellor's grasp. Reaching Blackpoint The Black Highway Blackpoint lies at the Southwestern terminus of the Black Highway, the largest trade route in Easter Tritan, connecting the two capitals of Blackpoint and Siddar City. The road is wide, well maiantained, and most importantly, safe. The road is constantly patrolled by the Dusk Templars up until the Republic takes over some distance past Ravenhelm. The road passes through several small towns, but none are particularly worthy of note. Many of the towns have little to offer other than simple agricultural products and raw materials. As the towns get closer to Blackpoint, the attitude becomes colder and less receptive. The small villages just outside the city practically stare down any outsiders that wander through. The Gates of Blackpoint As Blackpoint is composed of interlocking walled enclaves, the outer gates of the city are but the first of many checkpoints the party will need to pass in order to get access to the city proper. There are a dozen or so outer gates open at any given time, but only four have a customs station where non-citizens can gain the paperwork necessary to traverse through the city. These four gates are located on enclaves that were destroyed during the Great Sack, and still show much of the damage today. The Inns Near each of the main four gates is a small inn, where visitors to the city can spend the night and get some rest from the long journey. Unlike the nearby villages, these inns depend entirely on foreign visitors, and extend them every courtesy. The innkeepers vary, but they are all pleasant and charming, a stark contrast to the surrounding villagers. Typical names for the innkeepers are Sean, Anraoi, Paidi, Eithne, Aibell, or Eimear. A short conversation with the inkeepers reveals that the entrances to the city are limited for foreigners, and few are allowed in without prior business in the city. A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check with the inkeeper can reveal some useful information to enter the city with fewer complications. Alternatively, a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the inn's patrons may reveal similar information. Roll Result 15 The inkeeper knows a merchant willing to pretend they are part of his security escort - for a price (1000 gp). He will take the party as far as the first enclave where his destination lies. 18 The inkeeper knows that one of the Crown inspectors (Sioda) at the Station has a sick daughter, and may be willing to look the other way in exchange for some money for medicine (500 gp). The inspector will furnish the party with temporary entry permits, good for a pair of days. 20 The inkeeper reveals that one of the patrons has been selling forged entry permits (250 gp). The forgeries will withstand a moderate degree of scrutiny, but should provide access to the inner city. The Customs Station The Customs Stations are only open between sunrise and sunset. Any travelers arriving outside those hours are directed by the guards on duty to one of the nearby inns. Once it is daytime, the Customs Station is open, and the guards will usher everyone without a valid entry permit into the small guardhouse where the inspector is located. Roll Name Description 1-10 Darearca (F) A good natured inspector, she takes pride in her work but is willing to accomodate travelers to the extent allowed by the Crown. 11-15 Declan (M) A bookish inspector, he is interested in hearing tales of faraway lands. If indulged, he will be fairly generous with travelers. 16-20 Sidoa (M) A bitter inspector, Sioda takes no joy in his job, and appears to be very distracted during the inspection. A DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that his daughter is sick, and he needs money for medicine (500gp). Without some additional help through the checkpoint, the party will be required to leave their weapons at the Customs Station, to be retrieved upon exit. Only licensed caravan guards to known merchants are allowed to keep their weapons. The gate is guarded by about 15 soldiers, with dozens of Dusk Templars only moments away. Trying to break through the checkpoint will throw the enclave into lockdown, and immediately make the party wanted enemies of the Dohlaran Crown. This will make it much harder to avoid detection and can introduc complications once inside the city. Additionally, ancient magic items are expressly forbidden, and will be confiscated and not returned if discovered. This information is common knowledge, and the party should take care not to have such items on their person. In the interests of greater diplomacy, the inspectors will remind the party of this fact and allow them to come back another day when they are better prepared. The insspector on duty will thoroughly check the party, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon through. If caught, the weapon(s) will be removed and placed in the depository. Should a member of the party attempt to smuggle a weapon through again, the entire party will have their passes revoked, and will need to try again in about a week's time. Inside the Outer Enclaves The Ruined District The outermost enclaves of the city were almost entirely destroyed by Baltatrax during the Great Sack. Many of the buildings are significantly newer and of a different architecture than those inside the inner city. The outer enclaves tend to be a mix of poorer housing and industries. Many merchants have supply contracts here, and accomodations and supplies may be easily found. Travel between the outer enclaves is not restricted, and permits are rarely checked. These enclaves are typically run by the local nobility, who are less willing to spend more than is necessary on security, and there are plenty of warehouses and shanties to hide in should the need arise. Gardhynyr Trade House The Gahrdynyr Trade House, one of the major trading organizations within the Republic, has a major depot here. If the party has good relations with the Republic, they may have been gifted a letter of introduction, or even a Republic Warrant, which can be presented to the intendant at the Gardhynyr Trade House, Orval Morrissy. The intendant doesn't officially run the trade house, but he has the most up to date and accurante information, as he is the primary contact for merchants and local businessmen. A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can gain the party a lot of valuable information about the city, including the local layout. With a suitable introduction, the intendant will be much more forthcoming, allowing the party to roll with advantage. A warrant grants automatic success, as the intendant is entirely loyal to the Republic. The intendant can supply the party with additional paperwork to allow them easier travel into the inner city. The paperwork identifies the party as trade representatives, and for all intents and purposes is genuine. Without a warrant, the intendant will want some form of compensation for the paperwork, but he is not interested in money. He wants a magic item, forbidden contraband within the city, and he's not too particular about what he gets. If the party may not have a magic item they are willing to part with, the intendant knows of some confiscated items at a local guardhouse that haven't been logged yet. It seems a merchant was foolish enough to attempt to hide the items, and was promptly discovered. The Guardhouse The guardhouse is located within the commercial zone, and is normally staffed by 20 guards, although many more can be called in case of an emergency. The guards mostly handle petty crimes, and don't suspect any kind of trouble will arise. At the depository of the guardhouse is a small trove of about a half dozen minor magic items, any of which will satisfy the intendant. To get to the depository, the party will need to: Sneak into the guardhouse ... ... during the day : DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check ... during the night : DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check Getting a layout of the guardhouse and guard rotations with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can grant advantage. Distract the guard at the repository entrance Unlock the depository where the items are held with a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check The depository guard has a set of keys, which can be lifted with a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.","title":"The Demon Core"},{"location":"DemonCore_GM/#the-demon-core","text":"","title":"The Demon Core"},{"location":"DemonCore_GM/#description","text":"Trapped within the golden mirror is the soul of an ancient and terrible demon.
