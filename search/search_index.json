Where the Shroud provides the initial energy to the weapon, it is the Demon Core that empowers the truly apocalyptic devastation the weapon wreaks. The Demon Core, like all pieces of the weapon, was separated and hidden by Hermes Trismegistus prior to the Great Sack. Unbeknownst to anyone outside Hermes' inner circle, the Demon Core was not buried in a desolate area, but was instead entrusted into the care of Lord Symnyr Lynch, Councillor of Blackpoint and a long-time personal friend. As prolongued exposure to the Core is extremely hazardous, the sphere was placed inside a leaden sarcophagus, and hidden deep within the catacombs under the city. Since then, the existence of the Demon Core and its final resting place has been a closely guarded secret, known only to the office of the Blackpoint Councillor, and after the Great Sack, the Royal Chancellor that superseded the title. Discovering the location of the Demon Core's sarcophagus is no easy task. The catacombs are a twisting maze of passages and chambers, many of which have not been accessed in centuries. Many of the catacomb entrances were sealed during the Great Sack, and the rest are heavily guarded by the Dusk Templars. Breaking into the catacombs will be a difficult proposition, second only to breaking out with the sarcophagus. Alternatively, a diplomatic approach may be possible. The current Chancellor, Lord Reynfred, has been searching for information about the weapon, as have his predecessors. Although the Chancellor would use the weapon for his own purposes, the Lynch family remains the unofficial protectors of the Demon Core. Yrvyn Lynch serves as the Chancellor's clerk, has access to his ancestor's records, and has been looking for a way to secure the Demon Core from the Chancellor's grasp. Reaching Blackpoint Black Highway Blackpoint lies at the Southwestern terminus of the Black Highway, the largest trade route in Easter Tritan, connecting the two capitals of Blackpoint and Siddar City. The road is wide, well maiantained, and most importantly, safe. The road is constantly patrolled by the Dusk Templars up until the Republic takes over some distance past Ravenhelm. The road passes through several small towns, but none are particularly worthy of note. Many of the towns have little to offer other than simple agricultural products and raw materials. As the towns get closer to Blackpoint, the attitude becomes colder and less receptive. The small villages just outside the city practically stare down any outsiders that wander through. Gates of Blackpoint As Blackpoint is composed of interlocking walled enclaves, the outer gates of the city are but the first of many checkpoints the party will need to pass in order to get access to the city proper. There are a dozen or so outer gates open at any given time, but only four have a customs station where non-citizens can gain the paperwork necessary to traverse through the city. These four gates are located on enclaves that were destroyed during the Great Sack, and still show much of the damage today. Blackpoint Village Inns Near each of the main four gates is a small inn, where visitors to the city can spend the night and get some rest from the long journey. Unlike the nearby villages, these inns depend entirely on foreign visitors, and extend them every courtesy. The innkeepers vary, but they are all pleasant and charming, a stark contrast to the surrounding villagers. Typical names for the innkeepers are Sean, Anraoi, Paidi, Eithne, Aibell, or Eimear. A short conversation with the inkeepers reveals that the entrances to the city are limited for foreigners, and few are allowed in without prior business in the city. A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check with the inkeeper can reveal some useful information to enter the city with fewer complications. The table below has some options for what the inkeeper may reveal, or if the party rolls well, may be options he presents the party. Alternatively, a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the inn's patrons may reveal similar information. Roll Result 1-7 The inkeeper knows a merchant willing to pretend they are part of his security escort - for a price (1000 gp). He will take the party as far as the outer enclaves where his destination lies. 8-15 The inkeeper knows that one of the Crown inspectors (Sioda) at the Station has a sick daughter, and may be willing to look the other way in exchange for some money for medicine (500 gp). The inspector will furnish the party with temporary entry permits, good for a pair of days. 16-20 The inkeeper reveals that one of the patrons has been selling forged entry permits (250 gp). The forgeries will withstand a moderate degree of scrutiny, but should provide access to the inner city. Customs Station The Customs Stations are only open between sunrise and sunset. Any travelers arriving outside those hours are directed by the guards on duty to one of the nearby inns. Once it is daytime, the Customs Station is open, and the guards will usher everyone without a valid entry permit into the small guardhouse where the inspector is located. Roll Name Description 1-10 Darearca (F) A good natured inspector, she takes pride in her work but is willing to accomodate travelers to the extent allowed by the Crown. 11-15 Declan (M) A bookish inspector, he is interested in hearing tales of faraway lands. If indulged, he will be fairly generous with travelers. 16-20 Sidoa (M) A bitter inspector, Sioda takes no joy in his job, and appears to be very distracted during the inspection. A DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that his daughter is sick, and he needs money for medicine (500gp). Without some additional help through the checkpoint, the party will be required to leave their weapons at the Customs Station, to be retrieved upon exit. Only licensed caravan guards to known merchants are allowed to keep their weapons. The gate is guarded by about 15 soldiers, with dozens of Dusk Templars only moments away. Trying to break through the checkpoint will throw the enclave into lockdown, and immediately make the party wanted enemies of the Dohlaran Crown. This will make it much harder to avoid detection and can introduc complications once inside the city. Additionally, ancient magic items are expressly forbidden, and will be confiscated and not returned if discovered. This information is common knowledge, and the party should take care not to have such items on their person. In the interests of greater diplomacy, the inspectors will remind the party of this fact and allow them to come back another day when they are better prepared. The inspector on duty will thoroughly check the party, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon through. If caught, the weapon(s) will be removed and placed in the depository. Should a member of the party attempt to smuggle a weapon through again, the entire party will have their passes revoked, and will need to try again in about a week's time. Inside the Outer Enclaves The outermost enclaves of the city were almost entirely destroyed by Baltatrax during the Great Sack. Many of the buildings are significantly newer and of a different architecture than those inside the inner city. The outer enclaves tend to be a mix of poorer housing and industries. Many merchants have supply contracts here, and accomodations and supplies may be easily found. Travel between the outer enclaves is not restricted, and permits are rarely checked. These enclaves are typically run by the local nobility, who are less willing to spend more than is necessary on security, and there are plenty of warehouses and shanties to hide in should the need arise. Ruined Districts Some of the enclaves were far too damaged during the Great Sack, and have been converted into makeshift residences for many of the city's workers. Contrary to the common perception, these people are generally friendly and respectful to foreginers, whom they view with mild curiosity and a great deal of deference. Travelers are often addressed as 'my lord' or 'my lady', regardless of any true claim to nobility. Since many people's impression of Blackpoint comes from the outer villages or the nobility within, there is an assumption that the entirety of the citizenry shares a similar disdain for foreigners. It is not true to say, however, that the common folk think favorably of strangers. It's simply that the average commoner within the walls is secure in the knowledge that Blackpoint would never allow \"the wrong sort of people\" to stay, and anyone passing through is more of a temporary curiosity. To the common folk, decency and kindness are entirely unrelated to acceptance and tolerance. Gardhynyr Trade House The Gahrdynyr Trade House, one of the major trading organizations within the Republic, has a major depot here. If the party has good relations with the Republic, they may have been gifted a letter of introduction, or even a Republic Warrant, which can be presented to the intendant at the Gardhynyr Trade House, Orval Morrissy. The intendant doesn't officially run the trade house, but he has the most up to date and accurante information, as he is the primary contact for merchants and local businessmen. A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can gain the party a lot of valuable information about the city, including the local layout. With a suitable introduction, the intendant will be much more forthcoming, allowing the party to roll with advantage. A warrant grants automatic success, as the intendant is entirely loyal to the Republic. If the party inquires about more than just basics about the city, or directly asks about the catacombs or information related to the Demon Core, the intendant will suggest that the party visit the Crown Libraries within the Inner Enclaves, as that is the most likely place to find information about the history of the kingdom and the city. He will point out however that entering the Inner Enclaves is not a privilege extended to every traveler, and that special permits, such as those granted to trade company representatives. The intendant can supply the party with additional paperwork to allow them easier travel into the inner city. The paperwork identifies the party as trade representatives, and for all intents and purposes is genuine. Without a warrant, the intendant will want some form of compensation for the paperwork, but he is not interested in money. He wants a magic item, forbidden contraband within the city, and he's not too particular about what he gets. If the party may not have a magic item they are willing to part with, the intendant knows of some confiscated items at a local guardhouse that haven't been logged yet. It seems a merchant was foolish enough to attempt to hide the items, and was promptly discovered. Outer Enclave Guardhouse The guardhouse is located within the commercial zone, and is normally staffed by 20 guards, although many more can be called in case of an emergency. The guards mostly handle petty crimes, and don't suspect any kind of trouble will arise. At the depository of the guardhouse is a small trove of about a half dozen minor magic items, any of which will satisfy the intendant. To get to the depository, the party will need to: Sneak into the guardhouse ... ... during the day : DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check ... during the night : DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check Getting a layout of the guardhouse and guard rotations with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can grant advantage. Distract the guard at the repository entrance Unlock the depository where the items are held with a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check The depository guard has a set of keys, which can be lifted with a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Leave the guardhouse without alerting the guards. Additional complications may arise if the party is discovered. The guards will turn hostile, and the party can become wanted if they fight with the guards. It is possible that the party becomes notorious in Blackpoint, which will put guards on alert for persons matching the party's last known description. Here are some additional encounters that may arise while the party is retrieving the magic items from the depository: Roll Result 1-5 No additional encounters. 6-10 The depository guard is asleep on duty. 11-15 The guards respond to some altercation, reducing their numbers at the guardhouse by 2d4 + 2. 16-18 1d6 + 3 Dusk Templars arrive at the guardhouse. 19 The guards conduct a random inspection of the building. The party can avoid detection with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check. 20 A thief is already in the process of stealing the magic items. Inner Enclave Checkpoint Each enclave is connected to its neighbors via another large, well protected gate. Travel into the Inner Enclaves requires the appropriate paperwork, which can be obtained either via forged documents or by helping the Gahrdynyr Trade House intendant. Attempting to break through the checkpoints into the Inner Enclaves will result in the party becoming enemies of the Crown, and will unleash the full fury of the city's defenses. With the appropriate paperwork, the party will once again be inspected as they are considered untrustworthy foreigners. requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon or magic item through. It is possible to circumvent the need for permits, though this carries significant risk. Most of the poorer citizens of the Outer Enclaves do not have paperwork themselves, but some of the richer merchants and travelers may have paperwork that matches the party's general descriptions. These permits may be pickpocketed by a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. A failed check alerts the owner, who will cry for help against the would-be thief. Alternatively, the checkpoint itself could be bypassed, either by going over the walls, DC 15 Strength (Athletics), or through them with the appropriate spells. However, the guards in the Inner Enclaves will occasionally stop-check foreigners for paperwork, which can create complications if the permits are not produced. Inside the Inner Enclaves Unlike the Outer Enclaves, the inner sectors of Blackpoint are extremely well maintained, offering many beautiful sights of antecasum architecture. The citizens privileged enough to live in the Inner Enclaves are generally wealthy merchants, artesans, freemen, and the lower nobility. These enclaves are typically better patrolled and protected, and anyone who does not appear to belong can expect to present their permits several times throughout the day. Similar to the Outer Enclaves, travel within the same ring is significantly more relaxed. Permits typically do not need to be presented, unless an Enclave has been sealed due to a policing action, which is extremely rare. Travel to the Outer Enclaves is similarly unrestricted, though the guards will remind well-to-do citizens not to linger or leave the main boulevards that connect the inner checkpoints with the outer gates. Crown Library One of the Inner Enclaves is the site of the former Royal Academy, once a prestigious magical university. The Academy was shuttered during the Spellplague and the Great Sack, and many of its priceless tomes and artifacts were removed by the Crown. Since the Great Sack, the Crown has used the Academy grounds for various purposes throughout the years. Some of the buildings were used as warehouses for military goods, and the dormitories were repurposed as barracks for the Dohlaran Army at the height of the crisis. The various libraries and great halls were used as archives for the Crown's documents and records, but over time became general repositories for printed materials, and were eventually opened to a limited subset of the public as the Crown Library. Unless the party is clearly out of place within the Inner Enclaves, there should be no difficulty entering the libraries. Inside the Academy Enclave, paperwork is rarely checked, as the Academy grounds are not considered particularly restricted. It is possible to sneak into the libraries at night, as the grounds are not well illuminated and security is fairly lax. Tip Yrvyn Lynch, the Chancellor's Clerk and descendant of Symnyr Lynch, can often be found inside the library as part of his job. He may notice the party's research and approach them, as his family considers it their sacred duty to safeguard the Demon Core until it is needed. He can be recruited by presenting evidence that the party is affiliated with Hermes Trismegistus or Azoth the Wise. Once inside the library, the clerks can help the party find the appropriate records, but will become suspicious if the party asks too many direct questions about the catacombs, the Chancellor, the Demon Core, or any closely related subject. Warning The librarians may warn the Chancellor if they become too suspicious of the party's motives. They will claim that the information may take a few hours to compile, and invite the party to return early the next day. If the party has met and recruited Yrvyn Lynch, he will already know to expect the report. Otherwise, Yrvyn will intercept the librarians' report and interview the party upon their return, to ascertain whether they are allies or enemies. He will bring a dozen Dusk Templars with him as protection, but will dismiss them if recruited. The records can be searched manually to avoid attracting attention to the party's activities, using Intelligence (Investigation or History) checks of the appropriate DC. Topics marked as restricted require a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to bypass the librarian in the restricted section. DC Topic Information 10 Blackpoint (general) The party can learn general information about the city, including the layout of the Inner and Outer Enclaves, notable places and citizens (both current and historical). 15 Blackpoint (First Age) Information about the First Age is limited, but what records remain paint a terrible picture: the last free city, under siege from demonic forces, waiting desperately for relief to arrive. The records indicate that all the passages leading to the Inner & Crown Enclaves (including the catacombs) were sealed or collapsed during this era. 12 Symnyr Lynch The Councillor entrusted to safeguard the Demon Core in the First Age. The only record that remains is a last will and testament, specifying that the Councillor's last wishes were for his family to take up the protection of Blackpoint and the treasures enshrined deep within the city as their personal calling. 15 Nell Reynfred The Chancellor was once the leading Baron of Ravenhelm. The official history states that he was chosen over the local nobility as a reward for his devotion to the protection of the city, but an official record that was stored in the library accidentally reveals that it was part of a settlement to keep the Ravenhelm nobility from rebelling against the Crown. 10 Thamior Maximilien X The current Monarch of Dohlar has not made much impact on the records, but there is a record of granted petitions for audience that indicate he is willing to be enterntained by faraway travelers. 17 [Restricted] Catacombs The restricted architectural records indicate that the catacomb entrances outside the Crown Enclaves have all been sealed or collapsed during the Great Sack. The only remaining entrance lies within the innermost enclaves. A rough map of the currently known catacomb layout is included, but its clear that the map is incomplete. The entire third level map is missing, with a note that it was destroyed on the order of Chancellor Morrin Lynch. 15 [Restricted] Artifacts No direct mention can be found about the Demon Core here, but there are several records indicating that the Crown systematically confiscated powerful magical artifacts after the end of the Spellplague. The records indicate that most of these items have since been retrieved, save for those lost too deep within the catacombs. 10 [Restricted] Dusk Templars The party can gain some detailed information about the equipment of Dusk Templars and some of their tactics. Additionally, the requisition forms over the past few decades suggest that the Dusk Templars have begun to train arcane casters as part of their ranks. 15 [Restricted] Crown Enclaves General information about the innermost enclaves of the city, including maps and information about notable places and citizens. The maps indicate the location of the known catacomb entrances. Crown Enclave Checkpoint The innermost enclaves of Blackpoint are controlled directly by the Dohlaran Crown, and are off-limits to anyone without official business. Forged documents will not pass muster, and repeated failed attempts to pass with improper documentation will cause the party to become wanted. Short of bypassing the checkpoint entirely by sneaking over the enclave walls, the only way through is with an official invitation. If the party has met and recruited Yrvyn Lynch, he can provide the party with the necessary invitation as the Chancellor's clerk. The party can attempt to request an audience with the King by petitioning the local magistrates. If the party highlights their knowledge of faraway people and places in the petition, the King will most likely grant the audience, though it will take several days for an invitation to be issued. The Gahrdynyr Trade House intendant's papers can be used to request entrance, but only if the party has asked the intendant to set up an audience with the appropriate ministers. Tip If the catacombs, the Demon Core, or magical artifacts are brought up as part of the audience requests, Yrvyn Lynch has a standing order with all the ministerial clerks to route the audience request directly to himself, under the guise of secret orders from the Chancellor. He will interview the party directly, and attempt to ascertain whether they share a common goal, or whether they should be arrested on the spot. Regardless of the method of entry, the party should take care not to stray too far from their official destination. The Dusk Templars actively and thoroughly patrol the Crown Enclaves, checking for papers to anyone not wearing a small lapel pin that identifies them as Crown officials. Noticing the pattern (or the pins) requires a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception or Insight) check. Hiding from the patrols is extremely difficult, requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check, repeated in 10-minute intervals. Crown Enclaves The Crown Enclaves are the innermost enclaves, encompassing the palace grounds, the army headquarters, and the Crown offices that host the government. Very few people actually live in the Crown Enclaves, with only the royal family and the oldest Dohlaran noble families having any sort of permanent residence within. These enclaves are heavily patrolled by the Dusk Templars, and contain the only known entrances to the catacombs in which the Demon Core is hidden. Crown Offices If the party requested an audience that piqued the interest of Yrvyn Lynch, they are directed to the appropriate building within the Crown offices, where Yrvyn will be waiting, and will attempt to determine whether the party is on his side, or if they represent a threat to either himself or the Crown. Yrvyn is not disloyal to the Crown, but he believes that his family has a higher calling to protect the Demon Core until it is needed. He can be convinced to help the party by presenting evidence that they are on a quest for Hermes Trismegistus or Azoth the Wise. Simply mentioning them is insufficient, and he will immediately suspect that the party is searching for the Demon Core for nefarious purposes. Once convinced of the party's noble intentions, Yrvyn will suggest that they meet up in a more discreet location to continue the conversation. Yrvyn will suggest a suitable location if none is presented by the party. If the party did not happen upon Yrvyn, and meet with one of the ministers, they will quickly be dismissed and escorted out of the Crown Enclaves unless they can successfully bluff their way through the audience. Depending on how the party plays it, this can be a Charisma (Deception or Performance), Wisdom (Insight), or Intelligence (History), all at DC 25. A successful pass will allow them to remain on the Crown Enclaves without being escorted out. Meetup with Yrvyn When the party rendezvous with Yrvyn, they can gain a great deal of information about the catacombs and the Demon Core's location. Yrvyn's great-great-great grandfather ordered the desruction of most of the official records when it became clear that the Crown could not be trusted with the artifact. Fortunately for the party, the Lynch family kept their own set of records, and although they could not save a map, there is a record of Symnyr's directions to reach the artifact's vault. He will also mention that some of the catacomb exits were hidden rather than sealed, and although their locations are unknown, it should be possible to exit the catacombs from a different location, possibly in the Outer Enclaves, but it would be next to impossible to find that exit from outside. Most importantly however, Yrvyn has keys to the various catacomb gates, which have been enchanted against picking and would otherwise require a DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to bypass, or a DC 15 check if Dispell or Knock are used on each gate. Lastly, Yrvyn can help create a distraction to draw away the Dusk Templars and allow the party to enter the catacombs more easily from within the Crown Enclaves. Entering the Catacombs There are about a half dozen catacomb entrances within the Crown Enclave, though only one is particularly suitable for the party to use. The entrance is located inside the Draseotheoa, a massive First Age temple to long forgotten gods. If the party has learned the location of the catacomb entrances from Yrvyn or some other source, they can head directly there. Otherwise, the party will need to explore the Crown Enclaves to try to locate the entrances. A DC 20 Intelligence (History or Religion) check can provide insight that the catacombs would have been used as burial chambers during the First Age, and First Age temples would have been connected to the catacombs. The best catacomb entrance is hidden underneath the statue of the Dragon God inside the Draseotheoa. Normally, a pair of Dusk Templars patrol the wing of the temple where the statue is located. If Yrvyn was recruited, these guards are not present. Otherwise the Dusk Templars will pass by the statue every 5 minutes. Draseotheoa The Draseotheoa is the holiest site in Blackpoint. A massive First Age temple, the Draseotheoa boasts a massive central nave flanked by two rows of intricately carved columns. The stained glass windows that line the Aisles depict imagery of the Old Pantheon's miracles, though the accompanying lore has largely been lost to the ages. Two transepts flank the central altar, in which the idols and statues of the ancient gods are kept as a reminder of what once was. An octagonal chapterhouse abuts the choir, in which sits a colossal statue of a dragon. The statue of the Dragon God is a massive marble statue and one of the cultural treasures of Blackpoint. During the First Age, the Draseotheoa was constructed to honor the old pantheon, but as the city's patron god, the Dragon God was given a dedicated room in the temple. The statue bears a small inscription in draconic scratched behind the base, which reads: Quote Lips to lips, mouth to mouth, Comes the speaker of the shrouds, Suck in the spirit, speak the words, Let secrets of the dead be heard. Inspecting the statue's mouth, a small switch can be felt. When activated, a wall panel behind the statue reveals a secret door into the catacombs. Catacombs of Blackpoint The catacombs of Blackpoint refer to a massive complex of interconnected subterranean tunnels and chambers that serve as the final resting place of hundreds, if not thousands, of Blackpoint's paragons of the past millenia. Originally, the catacombs were a disjoint collection of mining tunnels and crypts that crisscrossed the ground beneath the city. Over the course of a thousand years, parts of the catacombs were found, forgotten, collapsed, expanded, or even sealed off, until a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers were left behind. No complete map of the catacombs has ever existed, but the most well known sections are the undercrofts beneath the surviving temples. During the Great Sack, most of the entrances to the catacombs were sealed or destroyed to prevent the invading hordes from using them to bypass the enclave walls. Only the Royal Crypts and the entraces within the Royal Enclaves were preserved, as the Crown planned to use the labyrinth in a last ditch attempt to survive should Baltatrax and his hordes breach the inner city. The catacombs beneath the Draseotheoa span three levels. The first level holds hundreds of First Age cadavers, mostly in small alcoves cut into the walls of the tunnels. Only the most honored of the dead were granted the privilege of a crypt or sarcophagus. The second level contains far fewer remains, mostly along the first set of tunnels leading to the first level. The Royal Crypts are located in the second level, along with the Royal Vaults, which house many of the Crown's ancient treasures. The third and final level was sealed shut behind a massive, warded gateway, under orders from Councillor Ermylynd Lynch in the First Century. In the Fifth Century, Morrin Lynch had all of the records pertaining to the third level destroyed, in order to keep the Demon Core's location hidden. Catacombs Level 1 The first level of the Catacombs beneath the Draseotheoa connect to the rest of the catacomb network at many locations. This level is dominated by long, winding corridors lined with the remains of long forgotten heroes. TBD : Map, description, layout, etc. Catacombs Level 2 The second level has far fewer remains than the first, and the layout is a little less haphazard. There are far fewer connections to the rest of the catacombs, having been constructed only once the first level was nearly full. TBD : Map, description, layout, etc. Catacombs Level 3 The third and last level of the catacombs is far less impressive than the prior two, containing almost no loculi (wall graves), and only an occasional room with unmarked sarcophagi. The layout however is far more labyrinthean, seemingly designed with the intent of confounding anyone trying to make their way without a map. TBD : Map, description, layout, etc. Leaving the Catacombs With the sarcophagus secure, the party can make their way back through the catacombs to either the first or second level. Both levels have various connections to the rest of the network, and can attempt to navigate the passages to a different, possibly blocked catacomb entrance. With Yrvyn's instructions, it should be relatively straightforward to chart a path to one of the hidden exits within the Outer Enclaves, giving the party a large advantage in retrieving the Demon Core. The remaining hidden exits are all inside older, sometimes abandoned temples, and have merely been plastered over. If the party has no instructions, the catacombs are treacherous to navigate, requiring a DC 30 Survival check to avoid getting lost. A successful check brings the party to one of the Outer Enclave exits, but a failed check returns them to one of the six Royal Enclaves entrances: Roll Result 1 Rock of Cashel 2 Crown Offices 3 Kilmainham Gaol 4 Cloughoughter Cathedral 5 Caherminnaun Dun 6 Draseotheoa Royal Enclave Catacomb Exits Rock of Cashel The palace grounds exit is located within the inner courtyard's chapel, hidden behind a false wall that can be rotated out of the way in the choir. The palace has a large number of servants and soldiers, and is the most difficult exit to use. Avoiding the Templar patrols requires a DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check every 10 minutes (DC 20 at night). The chapel is fortunately not too distant from the walls which lead to the Draseotheoa's enclave. Crown Offices The catacombs exit in the Crown Offices in the abbey next to the Chancellor's Office. During the day, the Crown Offices are a bustling administrative center, making it nearly impossible to avoid being seen, but at night there is only the occasional Templar patrol, and even more rarely, a clerk burning the midnight oil. Kilmainham Gaol The altar in the jail's chapel slides out of the way to reveal an entrance to the catacombs, but requires a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock. The chapel is located in the back courtyard, and is usually empty. Unfortunately, the jail is surrounded by a moat, with the main jail entrance the only bridge to the rest of the enclave. Cloughoughter Cathedral While not as famous as the Draseotheoa, the Cloughoughter Cathedral serves as the Primate's seat, and doubles as the Cult's administrative center. The catacomb exit is located in the chapterhouse that has become the Blackpoint Cult's assembly. This room is generally deserted, but is the farthest room from the cathedral entrance. Caherminnaun Dun A fortification outside the Crown Palace, the Caherminnaun Dun is the primary base of the Dusk Templars. The catacombs exit directly into the abbey within the training grounds, and is the only non-hidden entrance. A simple locked gate prevents access to the catacombs, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to open. The training grounds are almost never empty, with usually a dozen or so Templar squires practicing under the watchful eye of at least two Templar Knights. Outer Enclaves Catacombs Exits Of over a hundred exits in the Outer Enclaves, only four are still usable as an exit, as they were merely plastered over rather than collapsed or filled in. A DC 13 Strength check can be used to break through the plaster, or alternatively, the plaster wall has AC 11 and 100 hp. The party will then emerge in either a chapterhouse or a choir. If the party is following Yrvyn's directions, they should find themselves at M\u00e9l of Ardagh, one of the oldest temples still in use. Otherwise, they will emerge randomly at one of the four plastered exits.

Where the Shroud provides the initial energy to the weapon, it is the Demon Core that empowers the truly apocalyptic devastation the weapon wreaks. The Demon Core, like all pieces of the weapon, was separated and hidden by Hermes Trismegistus prior to the Great Sack. Unbeknownst to anyone outside Hermes' inner circle, the Demon Core was not buried in a desolate area, but was instead entrusted into the care of Lord Symnyr Lynch, Councillor of Blackpoint and a long-time personal friend. As prolongued exposure to the Core is extremely hazardous, the sphere was placed inside a leaden sarcophagus, and hidden deep within the catacombs under the city. Since then, the existence of the Demon Core and its final resting place has been a closely guarded secret, known only to the office of the Blackpoint Councillor, and after the Great Sack, the Royal Chancellor that superseded the title. Discovering the location of the Demon Core's sarcophagus is no easy task. The catacombs are a twisting maze of passages and chambers, many of which have not been accessed in centuries. Many of the catacomb entrances were sealed during the Great Sack, and the rest are heavily guarded by the Dusk Templars. Breaking into the catacombs will be a difficult proposition, second only to breaking out with the sarcophagus. Alternatively, a diplomatic approach may be possible. The current Chancellor, Lord Reynfred, has been searching for information about the weapon, as have his predecessors. Although the Chancellor would use the weapon for his own purposes, the Lynch family remains the unofficial protectors of the Demon Core. Yrvyn Lynch serves as the Chancellor's clerk, has access to his ancestor's records, and has been looking for a way to secure the Demon Core from the Chancellor's grasp.","title":"Description"},{"location":"DemonCore_GM/#reaching-blackpoint","text":"","title":"Reaching Blackpoint"},{"location":"DemonCore_GM/#black-highway","text":"Blackpoint lies at the Southwestern terminus of the Black Highway, the largest trade route in Easter Tritan, connecting the two capitals of Blackpoint and Siddar City.

The Academy was shuttered during the Spellplague and the Great Sack, and many of its priceless tomes and artifacts were removed by the Crown. Since the Great Sack, the Crown has used the Academy grounds for various purposes throughout the years. Some of the buildings were used as warehouses for military goods, and the dormitories were repurposed as barracks for the Dohlaran Army at the height of the crisis. The various libraries and great halls were used as archives for the Crown's documents and records, but over time became general repositories for printed materials, and were eventually opened to a limited subset of the public as the Crown Library. Unless the party is clearly out of place within the Inner Enclaves, there should be no difficulty entering the libraries. Inside the Academy Enclave, paperwork is rarely checked, as the Academy grounds are not considered particularly restricted. It is possible to sneak into the libraries at night, as the grounds are not well illuminated and security is fairly lax.

He may notice the party's research and approach them, as his family considers it their sacred duty to safeguard the Demon Core until it is needed. He can be recruited by presenting evidence that the party is affiliated with Hermes Trismegistus or Azoth the Wise. Once inside the library, the clerks can help the party find the appropriate records, but will become suspicious if the party asks too many direct questions about the catacombs, the Chancellor, the Demon Core, or any closely related subject. Warning The librarians may warn the Chancellor if they become too suspicious of the party's motives. They will claim that the information may take a few hours to compile, and invite the party to return early the next day. If the party has met and recruited Yrvyn Lynch, he will already know to expect the report. Otherwise, Yrvyn will intercept the librarians' report and interview the party upon their return, to ascertain whether they are allies or enemies. He will bring a dozen Dusk Templars with him as protection, but will dismiss them if recruited.

The records indicate that all the passages leading to the Inner & Crown Enclaves (including the catacombs) were sealed or collapsed during this era. 12 Symnyr Lynch The Councillor entrusted to safeguard the Demon Core in the First Age. The only record that remains is a last will and testament, specifying that the Councillor's last wishes were for his family to take up the protection of Blackpoint and the treasures enshrined deep within the city as their personal calling. 15 Nell Reynfred The Chancellor was once the leading Baron of Ravenhelm. The official history states that he was chosen over the local nobility as a reward for his devotion to the protection of the city, but an official record that was stored in the library accidentally reveals that it was part of a settlement to keep the Ravenhelm nobility from rebelling against the Crown. 10 Thamior Maximilien X The current Monarch of Dohlar has not made much impact on the records, but there is a record of granted petitions for audience that indicate he is willing to be enterntained by faraway travelers. 17 [Restricted] Catacombs The restricted architectural records indicate that the catacomb entrances outside the Crown Enclaves have all been sealed or collapsed during the Great Sack.

The records indicate that most of these items have since been retrieved, save for those lost too deep within the catacombs. 10 [Restricted] Dusk Templars The party can gain some detailed information about the equipment of Dusk Templars and some of their tactics. Additionally, the requisition forms over the past few decades suggest that the Dusk Templars have begun to train arcane casters as part of their ranks. 15 [Restricted] Crown Enclaves General information about the innermost enclaves of the city, including maps and information about notable places and citizens.

No complete map of the catacombs has ever existed, but the most well known sections are the undercrofts beneath the surviving temples. During the Great Sack, most of the entrances to the catacombs were sealed or destroyed to prevent the invading hordes from using them to bypass the enclave walls.

The catacombs beneath the Draseotheoa span three levels. The first level holds hundreds of First Age cadavers, mostly in small alcoves cut into the walls of the tunnels.

As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon, they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival. The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world. Random First Age Treasure First Age materials for use with Azoth's enchantment circle, or sold at a high profit on the Siddar/Blackpoint markets. To this end, the party should be encouraged to thoroughly search and explore the area. Note that the random treasure tables on this sheet typically do not specify a quantity. For example, searching through Arkala may yield \"Ruined Book or Manuscript\", but it would be strange for the entire town to possess only a single damaged book. You may roll multiple times on the treasure tables to generate additional treasures, and you may roll to determine the quantity of each treasure that is generated. Treasure comes in various \"grades\": Ruined / Rusted / Shattered Good / Acceptable / Damaged Excellent / Intact Unique Treasure Quantities: Ruined : 4d6 Good : 1d8 Excellent : 1d2 (or just 1) Unique treasure is usually a magic item or a named item, either directly granted by the table or rolled on one of the Magic Item Tables from the DMG. These can be things like \"+\" weapons, armor, and ammo, magic wands, magic scrolls, potions, and named magic items. Reaching the Ophidian Valley The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage, only half return alive. Serpent's Pass The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass, an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls levied at Ravenhelm. The highway is well traveled, and both the Expedition and the Dusk Templars routinely patrol the area. Merchant caravans are routinely encountered, providing an opportunity for trade and resupply before heading out into the unclaimed wilderness. Lashend Road Fork From the Serpent's Pass within the valley forks the Lashend Road, the old highway that leads to Terraworth and the South March Province. The fork has been barricaded off, with dozens of hazard signs in all languages warning travelers to the dangers beyond. Unlike the Serpent's Pass, Lashend Road is not patrolled and has fallen victim to disuse and disrepair for centuries. Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs, the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded, forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be necessary to avoid getting lost. Lashend River The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city. One of Baltatrax's first moves was to block and dam the river's source, knowing fully well that the city would collapse much more quickly as a result. Today, the river is but a small stream running through a dry, rocky riverbed. As the river is one of the only sources of clean water in the area, it tends to attract all manner of creatures, including the monsters that inhabit the area. The table below contains possible encounters for the party as they travel along the Lashend Road. D6 Encounter 1 Gnoll Hunting Pack (2d8 Hunters, 3d8 Gnolls, 1d4 Flesh Gnawers) 2 1d4 Leucrotta Leucrottas 3 2d6 Death Dogs 4 Kobold Tribe (2d20 Kobolds, 1d6 Kobold Inventors, 1d3 Kobold Scale Sorcerers, 1d6 Kobold Dragonshield) 5 Orc Tribe 6 Yuan-ti Tribe Towns of Terraworth Like any major city, Terraworth was supported by a network of smaller towns and villages that supplied much of the food and raw materials needed by the city. These abandoned villages often hide minor relics of the First Age, which can fetch a decent price on the artifacts market. Small icons and statues of the Old Gods are the most common relic, but once in a blue moon a lucky hunter finds a wondrous item that still holds a bit of magic. Random Town Relics Roll Result 01 - 05 Damaged Icon or Statue of an Old Pantheon God 06 - 10 Ruined Book or Manuscript 11 - 15 Rusted or Shattered Weapon or Tool 16 Good Quality Icon or Statue of an Old Pantheon God 17 Excellent Quality Icon or Statue of an Old Pantheon God 18 Good Quality Book or Manuscript 19 Excellent Quality Book or Manuscript 20 Intact Weapon or Tool The towns of Terraworth are relatively safe compared to the central city, but the players may still encounter dangerous creatures. In particular, an Adult Blue Dragon has made its lair to the far Southwest of Terraworth, and occasionally passes over the region while hunting. The dragon's lair is covered in a separate, dedicated section. One of these encounters is a patrol by [Pleas Morgan's] (EmeraldTablet_GM.md#pleas-morgan) minions. These minions will behave differently than the other local creatures, as they will attempt to send a runner into the city proper to alert their master to the intruders. If a runner makes it to the city, the players can expect heavier patrols as outlined in the [Pleas' Patrols)(EmeraldTablet_GM.md#pleas-patrols] section.

DC 18 Dexterity (Stealth) to avoid detection. Arkala Ruins The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was quickly evacuated. Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest. Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins. As the party passes by Arkala, they can discover that a small group of amateur relic hunters are currently under attack in Arkala. If it is nighttime when the party passes by Arkala, a faint blue-green glow can be seen emanating from the town, interspersed with the occassional flash of energy. The faint sounds of clashing metal and energetic blasts can be heard with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If it is daytime, a plume of black some can be seen rising into the air from the direction of Arkala, and the same Wisdom (Perception) check can be used to hear the sounds of combat. Ambush in Arkala As Terraworth is the nearest and least dangerous major ruin of the First Age, it is a popular spot for novice treasure hunters to cut their teeth before heading out into the true dangers of the South March and Southguard Provinces. On this occasion, a pair of prospective adventurers is under attack in Arkala. Leighya Treadway and Arther Bramer, natives of Lindmont to the Southeast of Archersreve, are fending off a group of monsters consisting of: * 4 x Skeleton * 2 x Will-o'-Wisp * 1 x Poltergeist * 1 x Deathlock Wight The pair, as experienced former Republic soldiers, are holding out among the ruins of the town, but are running out of ammunition and won't hold out for much longer. If the party decides not to investigate Arkala, the encounter above is skipped, and the amateur hunters will be encountered later, but missing much of their prepared equipment and information, having been forced to leave it all behind when escaping Arkala. Novice Adventurers Leighya and Arther, fresh out of a conscription stint with the Army of the Republic, decided not to extend their warrants but rather to strike it out on their own. The two childhood friends have always been enamored with stories of daring explorers recovering ancient relics, and resolved to make those dreams come true. The pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers. They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth revealing a long lost treasure. Over the last 6 months, after their deployment with the Republic Army, the two have gathered as much information about Terraworth as possible, and posses highly detailed copies of maps from the Royal Archives in Blackpoint, belived to be the best available. They also carry all manner of adventuring gear, from hundreds of feet of rope to pickaxes to ichor (flameless) lamps. They also had a horse-drawn cart, which has long gone missing after the horse fled the ambush, taking the heavier equipment with it. Despite all their preparation and combat training, the pair were shocked at the strength and ferocity of the attack upon them. According to their research, a few skeletons or possibly a wisp or two should have been the worst thing they could encounter. The two are further convinced that something really must have awoken within the city ruins, and are more determined than ever to find out. If the pair is rescued from the ambush in Arkala, they will reluctantly offer their support and vast knowledge of the city to the party, in exchange for a mutually-beneficial combined expedition. If the pair is encountered later on, they will make the same offer, but will only have their memorized knowledge available, as the maps and notes were destroyed when they were forced to flee Arkala. Some details will be missing, but between the pair they can remember every major step and landmark along their planned route. Regardless of how they are met, the pair will guide the party deep into the ruins of Terraworth, into what used to be the governmental district. Based on the information they've collected in the past several months indicates that there is a previously undiscovered vault beneath the Imperial Archives, which could hold untold riches. After a few hours together, the party will eventually notice that Leighya has been extremely careful when handling a small satchel. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check can allow the party to hear a faint rasping sound coming from within the sack, which quickly prompts Arther to gently pat the bag unconciously. If pressed, Arther and Leighya will try to avoid the subject, claiming that the satchel simply holds some delicate supplies (ointments, antiseptics, etc.). If pressed further to reveal the contents, they will claim that the contents are very sensitive and expensive. Both statements are clearly false, and it is obvious that the pair don't want to reveal the true contents of the bag. If confronted or otherwise forced to open the satchel, Arther and Leighya will begrudgingly comply, warning the party to listen to him and not make any hasty decisions. Gingerly reaching into the pouch, Arthur repeatedly tells the party to stay calm as he reveals an ancient-looking skull, meticulously adorned with holy sigils and purity seals. As the skull is pulled out of the satchel, an ominous amber light begins to glow from within the eyesockets, and with a deep, rasping breath the skull is momentarily sheathed in green flames - a Flameskull! Flameskull As the flameskull awakens, it's clear that the charms and icons are somehow keeping it from flying into the psychotic frenzy that traditionally characterizes the creature. As the flames once again flicker on and off, the skull rasps \"Help me...\" It's clear from the way that Arther and Leighya look and behave towards the flameskull that they have some emotional connection with it, possibly a combination of pity and sadness. If the party does not immediately attack and asks the pair to explain, Leighya will respond with their story. Quote We found him on our last mission. Our squad was sent to Terraworth to rescue some clueless merchants that were trying to find a shortcut to Rookwatch and got ambushed outside the ruins. He was just wandering aimlessly outside Arkala, cackling madly to itself every so often before crying out in anguish. We were just about to put an arrow through it when it suddenly turned and dashed towards us. I thought we were in for it when fire shot out from it's eyes, but instead of attacking us it hit the skeleton that had managed to sneak up behind us. I still remember the first words it said, \"Please, help me. I don't know what I am.\" Then it just swung violently between fits of laughter and despair. We didn't know what to do, but we had a cleric, Sister Powall, she said he might be remembering his former life. He'd just saved mine, I felt we owed it to him to try to help. Leighya will continue explaining that the charms and sigils help calm it, almost like a sleeping trance. They've managed to talk to flameskull when it has a rare moment of lucidity, and have learned a little bit about the pitiful creature they now care for: The Flameskull Former Life. The flameskull can remember very little about itself, only a momentary flash of a warrior in gleaming armor, perhaps a paladin. How it Died. The last image the creature can remember is of a sickening green pulse of energy consuming all of its vision. Who Created It. In undeath, the flameskull can remember things more vividly. It recalls being called to this life by a black-robed cultist, whose skin looked badly lesioned, as though he'd been severely burnt. Why it Behaves Strangely. For months, the skull had obeyed its creator, all the while screaming internally and descending into madness over the atrocities it was forced to commit. He'd been shattered at some point during a fight with soldiers. He remembers a cleric, perhaps something he did had broken the cultist's control, at least partially. Terraworth Loop At the third fork in the road on the way to Terraworth lies a loop that connects many of the surrounding town ruins with the city proper. The lower path leads to an abandoned Imperial outpost and the city of Terraworth, while the upper path leads to Krutoq's Tower and the supporting towns. Cardend and Falkirk Cardend and Falkirk are the two principal agricultural towns that once fed the massive populace of Terraworth. Like Arkala, the towns have been picked dry of any major First Age relics, leaving only the occasional rusted trinket. Occasionally, a band of monsters (from the table of Lashend River encounters) will take up temporary residence within the town ruins. It's clear that many prospective relic hunters have met their fate in these towns, as dessicated or skeletal remains can easily be found amongst the rubble. Basic adventuring supplies (rope, water bags, picks, torches, etc.) can be recovered from the remains. Kirkwall Ruins The mining town of Kirkwall stood to the far Northeast of Terraworth. The town was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was processed in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks of silver ore can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in hauling the heavy rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting. To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining complex, which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is rumored that the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to meet an untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most relic hunters avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation as well as a measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within. The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle. Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within the debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma. Further investigation of the debris reveals that the equipment is a hodgepodge of pieces from both the First and Second Ages. Smithing touchmarks range from the forges of Terraworth to the manufactoria of Siddar City. A DC 18 Intelligence (History) check can reveal that the tooling marks on the Siddarese weapons are of a factory-forge that was only opened (with much fanfare) within the past decade. Additionally, a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check shows that the corpses are significantly older, with many showing clear signs of weathering and erosion to a degree that would indicate hundreds of years of exposure rather than the less-than-ten years some of the weapons would suggest. Despite the apparent contradiction, both timelines are correct. A battle did take place approximately 4 years prior, between the creatures living within the mines and a skeletal army of an Elumin (Death domain) cleric, Pleas Morgan. Krutoq the Elven Lich Elandorr Krutoq, former Councillor of Terraworth, was an elven wizard from around 400 BGS. As Krutoq neared the end of his life, he became obsessed with the possibility of achieving immortality. Though very little is known about that time period, it is believed that Krutoq used his position and power to ensure his activities would not be halted. Indeed, Krutoq succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to convert the City's population into an undead army as payment to his fiendish patron. For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he had built ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious purposes. Krutoq was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery was never found. Given his high position within the city's government, Elandorr had successfully hidden his phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly that it would remain undisturbed until he could regenerate. Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection, leaving him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath. Should the phylactery be removed from the protection of the vault however, Krutoq would arise once again to a world without the Imperial might that once defeated him. Pleas Morgan Formerly a member of Blackpoint's clergy under the Primate, Pleas was drawn by the proscribed teachings of the dark side of Elumin, and was ejected from the priesthood for it. Pleas would have been executed for blasphemy, had he not been spirited away by like-minded cultists seeking his intimate knowledge of Blackpoint's ecclesiarchy. Morgan, acting on his twisted interpretation of Elumin's will, is attempting to locate Krutoq's phylactery within the ruins of Terraworth to revive the fallen lich. It is due to his efforts that rumors of an awakening in Terraworth have begun circulating the relic hunter community. Pleas, having been granted visions of a golden vault beneath Terraworth, is consumed with restoring the ancient lich. Krutoq's Tower To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses. Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower. At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper floors. The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held together by the barest of threads. Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check will find a forgotten satchel in the barracks that looks too new to be from the First Age. Inside the satchel, some minor rations and supplies can be found, but the only thing of interest is a notebook filled with incomprehensible symbols. A DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check is needed to decipher some of the journal. One page near the end has a map, but it is unlabeled and too low scale to figure out immediately. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check will allow the characters to realize that the map is of the former city of Terraworth. Pleas' Journal 569Y 7M 18KAL - I saw the light of the golden candles that shone down upon him who dwells beneath the brass gates, an angel cast out of the tribe of the martyr and sealed with hellfire. I know what I must do. My master wills it. The blasphemers who dared to cast me out shall taste the righteous hellfire of my master's wrath, delivered upon the swordpoint of the cast away angel. 569Y 10M 8IDE - I have found the brass gates, but the heretics' seals frustrate me still. My master grows impatient. I must not disappoint him. 570Y 1M 6NON - A vision came to me. I must walk in the angel's footsteps if I am to free him. I have studied the true holy texts of Elumin, and with the enchained angel's tomes I shall ascend to Elumin's side. 570Y 3M 12KAL - The first seal is broken. My master is pleased. The angel Elandorr shall once again spread my master's light throughout Tritan, and I shall have my revenge upon the apostates. Praise Elumin. Tomorrow, I shall return to the angel's keep and continue my search for the holy basin upon which the angel shall restore his heavenly host. 570Y 3M 3KAL I have failed in my search for the angel's basin. I can only trust in Elumin's grace that the angel shall prevail despite my failure. I will return to the brass gates on the morrow. City of Terraworth Once a great Imperial Free City, Terraworth was one of the first major cities to fall to Baltatrax's hordes during the period known as the Great Sack. In the rising turmoil of the collapse of the Empire, Terraworth found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the newly risen kingdoms and city states to the South, making it a tempting target for the Demon Lord's first major conquest. Terraworth Outskirts Like all great cities, Terraworth's growing population quickly outgrew the confines of the original walled city, leading to sprawling urban centers beyond the city walls. These outskirts, consisting primarily of lower class housing and industry, did not fare well under the onslaught of Baltatrax's attack, nor in the five centuries of abandonment that followed. In some sections, there is not a single standing building, with only foundations and partially buried rubble to indicate where a structure once stood. Many parts of the outskirts show weathered signs of fire damage, with the occasional mangled and rusted sword or speartip still embedded in an uncollapsed wall. The outskirts of the city are perilous for the inexperienced. Structures collapse with only the slightest disturbance, causing tons of rubble to fall on anyone unfortunate enough to be within. If a building collapses on someone, they can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to throw themselves under cover. On a failed check they take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on a successful check. One of the more recognizable sites on the city outskirts are the old Imperial Army Training Grounds. Although no structures remain, the large parade grounds are a dead giveaway. Based on their experience with the Expedition, Leighya will suggest that the training grounds may hold hidden underground caches of weapons and supplies. Indeed, a handful of caches lie exposed where treasure hunters have stumbled upon one. If Leighya has the Royal Archive maps, a pair of caches can be found easily. Without the maps, a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to find each of two caches. Each cache contains: One dozen mundane melee and ranged weapons One dozen armor pieces of mixed type Roll once on the Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5-10 Table in the DMG The outskirts are occasionally patrolled by Pleas' minions. At least one of the creatures will attempt to flee and alert his master to the intruders. If the minion manages to evade the party, encounters within the city are reinforced. The outskirt ruins have been largely picked clean, but the occasional minor relic can be found with a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check. These relics have no intrinsic powers or value, but are highly sought after in the Republic.

The buildings directly within the city walls show much the same damage as the buildings outside, and it is clear that a conflagration destroyed much of what the Demon Lord's hordes did not. The outer districts were primarily slums and industrial areas. The fabled Forges of Terraworth, which once armed and supplied the legions of the Imperial Army, are located in the outer districts. Most relic hunters who make it past the city walls venture no farther than the massive industrial foundries of the outer districts. The inner city is considered cursed, and recent stories of near-death escapes from terrifying creatures have done nothing to discourage this notion. The massive forges are known to hold hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of unfinished weapons and blanks. Despite the centuries of pillaging by both the hordes and adventurous relic hunters, it is difficult not to trip over the vast quantity of unfinished materiel in and around the forges. Most of the pieces are mundane and otherwise uninteresting aside from their age, but can fetch a fair price to the right buyers. The forges are comparatively safe, but if the party spends too long gathering blanks and scrap, there is a good chance that a random patrol will stumble upon them. While the forges are no longer lit, the area still contains several environmental hazards. Large acid vats, once used to clean blanks and stamps, have not lost much potency over the years. Flammeble materials are ubiquitous, and a stray spark or flame can result in lethal detonations. Hazard Trigger Effect Acid Pit DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) On fail: fall into the pit and take 2d6 acid damage per round. Explosive Barrel Electric or Fire Damage All creatures in a 20 ft. radius sphere take 7d6 fire damage. Collapsing Rubble On Missed Attack All creatures within 5 ft. of a rubble hazard take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Trip Hazard DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) On fail: fall prone. Beyond the forges lies the ruins of the tenement districts and commercial zones. The districts are largely burnt down, and there's nothing of particular interest within. A few of the remaining buildings contain the lairs of dangerous creatures, and are best avoided. Arther and Leighya will strongly suggest that the party avoid the rest of the Outer Districts. Brass Gates of Terraworth The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the surrounding ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district was through a set of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than twisted wrecks amidst the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular mindset as the defining line between the comparatively safe outer city and the terrors that lie within the inner city. The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures, ranging from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences to the collapsed domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored to hold powerful ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure hunters, the inner districts host many dangerous creatures and abominations. University of Arcane Sciences The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The magi of the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and enchantment advances that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the Empire. The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical laboratories. Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as hands-on workshops for many of the Empire's artificers. Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out skeleton of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small, dusty calderas. Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was ransacked due to the lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the rest of the University and the surrounding dormitories. The ruins are sure to contain artifacts buried under tons of rubble. A DC 16 Strength check and at least two hours of hard labor are needed to clear a region large enough to search. A subsequent DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find an artifact within the ruined buildings. Consult the following table for a success.

The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city, capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles. In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of cracking and stress. It is likely that the domes contain large amounts of First Age artifacts and relics, buried beneath the collapsed domes. A DC 17 Strength check is needed in order to clear off the large pieces of debris from an area in order to search. A subsequent successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the party to find interesting objects within the rubble. Roll Result 01 - 08 Good Quality Memorabilia 09 - 13 Excellent Quality Memorabilia 14 - 19 Intact Weapon 20 Roll once on Magic Item Table F The Hippodrome is a dangerous location within Terraworth, primarily due to the instability of the ruins. Most creatures avoid the domes, but if the party has been previously spotted by a patrol, then one of Pleas' patrols may stumble upon them. Much like an avalanche, any disturbance of the ruins can spell disaster for anyone caught in the region. If the party causes a small disturbance such as loud sounds, strong ground vibrations, explosions, or any result of carelessness or combat, roll 1d20. On a result of 19 - 20, the structure partially collapses. Everyone in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity Saving Throw to avoid being crushed by falling rubble. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save as they dodge the largest pieces. If a creature inside the dome triggers a partial collapse for any reason, roll 1d10. If the rolled number is less than the number of partial collapses that have occurred, the building fully collapses. Every creature within the structure takes 8d10 bludgeoning damage as the roof collapses. Great Bazaar The Great Bazaar to the north of the Hippodrome is a large, enclosed forumn that once held the bustling crowds of Terraworth's finest merchants and their customers. The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the invading hordes. Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived buried beneath the wreckage. A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to spot the item within the rubble. The Bazaar is relatively safe, subject only to the occasional patrol by Pleas' minions.

On a successful check over 25, use Magic Item Table F Imperial Forum The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the Imperial Palace. City Council Chamber The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration. As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives. The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along with several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements. The Council Chamber was cursed by Baltatrax after his conquest of the city. Upon entering the structure, a non-evil aligned creature must make a DC 18 Charisma Saving Throw, or gain a madness effect. Roll once on the Long-Term Madness table and apply the effect for 1d10 x 10 hours, or until cured through lesser restoration or remove curse . Basilica The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline, the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon. Unfortunately for the party, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped off the face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The only visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica floorplan. There is a hidden entrance to the Basilica Catacombs that has remained undisturbed since before the Great Sack. A DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to find the entrance. A subsequent DC 17 Strength check can force open the sealed entrance, or a DC 16 Intelligence (Religion or History) to deduce the correct unlocking sequence for the Old Pantheon symbols found carved into the stone. Basilica Catacombs The Basilica Catacombs hold the bodies of hundreds of Terraworth's holy figures, including the last Kings and Councillors of their respective eras. The catacombs are relatively small compared to the size of the city, as very few earned the honor of being buried within the hallowed ground. The catacombs connect via a secret tunnel to the Vault beneath the Imperial Palace. The passage is hidden behind a false burial shelf bearing the inscription 'Elandorr, City Councillor'. The sarcophagus within the shelf is empty and can be pulled away to reveal the passage. Imperial Gardens The Imperial Gardens consist of the Imperial Palace and surrounding grounds. The gardens were once a beautifully detailed botanical garden, typically only available to senior government officials and Imperial dignitaries. The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures, which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The vegetation is overgrown and many of the ground's water features have long since dried up, leaving only the cracked pool floors. Roll Result 01 - 20 TBD ENCOUNTERS Imperial Palace The Imperial Palace was originally the home of the Terraworth royal family in the time before the Empire. The Palace itself is a majestic U-shaped corps de logic , flanked on either side by symmetrical secondary wings. When the Empire formally annexed Terraworth, the Palace was converted into the seat of the Imperial Administration for the region. Most of the original royal apartments have been converted into offices and suites to hold the growing bureaucracy. Although the City Councillor traditionally held office within the Council Chamber, a small section of the Northern wing served as the private residence for the incumbent. Of particular interest to the Party, the cellars beneath the Palace were converted into the Terraworth Imperial Archives, the location of many of Terraworth's most valuable treasures, and the location of the Hidden Vault holding Krutoq's phylactery.

The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and craftsmen of today. It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord. As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon, they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival. The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.

To this end, the party should be encouraged to thoroughly search and explore the area. Note that the random treasure tables on this sheet typically do not specify a quantity. For example, searching through Arkala may yield \"Ruined Book or Manuscript\", but it would be strange for the entire town to possess only a single damaged book. You may roll multiple times on the treasure tables to generate additional treasures, and you may roll to determine the quantity of each treasure that is generated. Treasure comes in various \"grades\": Ruined / Rusted / Shattered Good / Acceptable / Damaged Excellent / Intact Unique Treasure Quantities: Ruined : 4d6 Good : 1d8 Excellent : 1d2 (or just 1) Unique treasure is usually a magic item or a named item, either directly granted by the table or rolled on one of the Magic Item Tables from the DMG.

The area is largely deserted; after civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage, only half return alive.","title":"Reaching the Ophidian Valley"},{"location":"EmeraldTablet_GM/#serpents-pass","text":"The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass, an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins.

Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs, the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded, forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be necessary to avoid getting lost.","title":"Lashend Road Fork"},{"location":"EmeraldTablet_GM/#lashend-river","text":"The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city.

Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest. Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins. As the party passes by Arkala, they can discover that a small group of amateur relic hunters are currently under attack in Arkala. If it is nighttime when the party passes by Arkala, a faint blue-green glow can be seen emanating from the town, interspersed with the occassional flash of energy. The faint sounds of clashing metal and energetic blasts can be heard with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The two childhood friends have always been enamored with stories of daring explorers recovering ancient relics, and resolved to make those dreams come true. The pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers. They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth revealing a long lost treasure. Over the last 6 months, after their deployment with the Republic Army, the two have gathered as much information about Terraworth as possible, and posses highly detailed copies of maps from the Royal Archives in Blackpoint, belived to be the best available. They also carry all manner of adventuring gear, from hundreds of feet of rope to pickaxes to ichor (flameless) lamps. They also had a horse-drawn cart, which has long gone missing after the horse fled the ambush, taking the heavier equipment with it. Despite all their preparation and combat training, the pair were shocked at the strength and ferocity of the attack upon them. According to their research, a few skeletons or possibly a wisp or two should have been the worst thing they could encounter. The two are further convinced that something really must have awoken within the city ruins, and are more determined than ever to find out. If the pair is rescued from the ambush in Arkala, they will reluctantly offer their support and vast knowledge of the city to the party, in exchange for a mutually-beneficial combined expedition. If the pair is encountered later on, they will make the same offer, but will only have their memorized knowledge available, as the maps and notes were destroyed when they were forced to flee Arkala. Some details will be missing, but between the pair they can remember every major step and landmark along their planned route. Regardless of how they are met, the pair will guide the party deep into the ruins of Terraworth, into what used to be the governmental district. Based on the information they've collected in the past several months indicates that there is a previously undiscovered vault beneath the Imperial Archives, which could hold untold riches. After a few hours together, the party will eventually notice that Leighya has been extremely careful when handling a small satchel. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check can allow the party to hear a faint rasping sound coming from within the sack, which quickly prompts Arther to gently pat the bag unconciously. If pressed, Arther and Leighya will try to avoid the subject, claiming that the satchel simply holds some delicate supplies (ointments, antiseptics, etc.). If pressed further to reveal the contents, they will claim that the contents are very sensitive and expensive. Both statements are clearly false, and it is obvious that the pair don't want to reveal the true contents of the bag. If confronted or otherwise forced to open the satchel, Arther and Leighya will begrudgingly comply, warning the party to listen to him and not make any hasty decisions. Gingerly reaching into the pouch, Arthur repeatedly tells the party to stay calm as he reveals an ancient-looking skull, meticulously adorned with holy sigils and purity seals. As the skull is pulled out of the satchel, an ominous amber light begins to glow from within the eyesockets, and with a deep, rasping breath the skull is momentarily sheathed in green flames - a Flameskull!","title":"Novice Adventurers"},{"location":"EmeraldTablet_GM/#flameskull","text":"As the flameskull awakens, it's clear that the charms and icons are somehow keeping it from flying into the psychotic frenzy that traditionally characterizes the creature. As the flames once again flicker on and off, the skull rasps \"Help me...\" It's clear from the way that Arther and Leighya look and behave towards the flameskull that they have some emotional connection with it, possibly a combination of pity and sadness. If the party does not immediately attack and asks the pair to explain, Leighya will respond with their story. Quote We found him on our last mission. Our squad was sent to Terraworth to rescue some clueless merchants that were trying to find a shortcut to Rookwatch and got ambushed outside the ruins. He was just wandering aimlessly outside Arkala, cackling madly to itself every so often before crying out in anguish. We were just about to put an arrow through it when it suddenly turned and dashed towards us. I thought we were in for it when fire shot out from it's eyes, but instead of attacking us it hit the skeleton that had managed to sneak up behind us. I still remember the first words it said, \"Please, help me. I don't know what I am.\" Then it just swung violently between fits of laughter and despair. We didn't know what to do, but we had a cleric, Sister Powall, she said he might be remembering his former life. He'd just saved mine, I felt we owed it to him to try to help. Leighya will continue explaining that the charms and sigils help calm it, almost like a sleeping trance. They've managed to talk to flameskull when it has a rare moment of lucidity, and have learned a little bit about the pitiful creature they now care for: The Flameskull Former Life. The flameskull can remember very little about itself, only a momentary flash of a warrior in gleaming armor, perhaps a paladin. How it Died. The last image the creature can remember is of a sickening green pulse of energy consuming all of its vision. Who Created It. In undeath, the flameskull can remember things more vividly. It recalls being called to this life by a black-robed cultist, whose skin looked badly lesioned, as though he'd been severely burnt. Why it Behaves Strangely. For months, the skull had obeyed its creator, all the while screaming internally and descending into madness over the atrocities it was forced to commit.

The town was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was processed in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks of silver ore can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in hauling the heavy rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting. To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining complex, which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is rumored that the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to meet an untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most relic hunters avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation as well as a measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within. The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle. Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within the debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma. Further investigation of the debris reveals that the equipment is a hodgepodge of pieces from both the First and Second Ages. Smithing touchmarks range from the forges of Terraworth to the manufactoria of Siddar City. A DC 18 Intelligence (History) check can reveal that the tooling marks on the Siddarese weapons are of a factory-forge that was only opened (with much fanfare) within the past decade. Additionally, a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check shows that the corpses are significantly older, with many showing clear signs of weathering and erosion to a degree that would indicate hundreds of years of exposure rather than the less-than-ten years some of the weapons would suggest.

Indeed, Krutoq succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to convert the City's population into an undead army as payment to his fiendish patron. For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he had built ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious purposes. Krutoq was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery was never found. Given his high position within the city's government, Elandorr had successfully hidden his phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly that it would remain undisturbed until he could regenerate. Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection, leaving him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath.

Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower. At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper floors. The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held together by the barest of threads. Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower.

In some sections, there is not a single standing building, with only foundations and partially buried rubble to indicate where a structure once stood. Many parts of the outskirts show weathered signs of fire damage, with the occasional mangled and rusted sword or speartip still embedded in an uncollapsed wall.

The outer districts were primarily slums and industrial areas. The fabled Forges of Terraworth, which once armed and supplied the legions of the Imperial Army, are located in the outer districts. Most relic hunters who make it past the city walls venture no farther than the massive industrial foundries of the outer districts. The inner city is considered cursed, and recent stories of near-death escapes from terrifying creatures have done nothing to discourage this notion.

The line is operated by the International Company of Sleeping Cars, I.C.S.C., by license of the Trans-Siddar Railroad, the Republic's semi-public rail corporation. This module focuses on a particularly unfortunate trip on the Sixth Day before the Ides of the Twelfth Moon of the Year 795 AGS (6IDE 3M 795Y). The Express, delayed due to a higher-precedence military rail convoy, is caught in a terrible blizzard West of Featherfurth, and derails on a snowbank. The following morning, two murders are discovered in the First Class sleeping car. What looks like an argument over gambling debts gone bad is quickly revealed as a double homicide, and with the blizzard raging, the killer must still be onboard. Passengers (NPC) Abner Cochran Race Human Age 62 Occupation Director of the Line Cabin A5 Reason for Travel Employee / Owner / Company Representative Keywords Former Gendarme, Devoted to ICSC, Kindly from Age Bio A former detective for the Siddar City Gendarmerie, Cochran was an early investor in the burgeoning railways of the Republic, making him fantastically wealthy. After his forced retirement, Cochran founded the International Company of Sleeping Cars with a group of investors, spurred by the dream of luxurious rail travel. Secret The I.C.S.C. Board has threatened to remove Cochran from the directorship if the company stock misses yet another earnings forecast. The news of an unsolved pair of murders on the train would be disastrous for public perception in the company. Alibi Cochran's dominant hand has no strength due to an accident during his days at the Gendarmerie. Additionally, he was with Mat Stoker and the engineers in the locomotive at the time of the crimes. Notable Silver Gray suit bearing the company lapel pin. Right hand doesn't clench. Right Handed, but learned to use Left. Testimony I was in the engine the entire time. As soon as the train struck the snowbank, I knew it would be trouble. After 30 years in the service you can just tell the difference between an hours-long delay and a days-long delay. Conductors Stoker and Wright came with me, the engineers will vouch for all of us. We were there until well past 1:00 AM. Stoker left temporarily to announce the delay to the passengers, but he returned within minutes. Colonel Isham Labey Race Dragonborn (Red) Age 45 Occupation Solder, Army of the Republic Cabin B3 Reason for Travel Transfer to Blackpoint Keywords Honorable, Upright, Slightly Stupid, Humorless Bio A veteran of the recent Western Conflicts, Col. Labey holds an automatic distrust bordering on outright xenophobia of foreigners. Dohlarans are only barely a step above the Western savages in his book. He was Katherine Rand's former superior officer during her youth in the military. Secret He is deeply in love with Ms. Rand, and has been secretly seeing her despite the risks to both (he was never implicated in the scandal that kicked her out of the Army, but could stand court martial for hiding it ever since). Alibi He was with Lette all throughout the night of the crime, beyond Pinkerton's suite. Notable He wears an Army dress uniform. Left Handed Testimony I was with Mr. Lette all night, discussing his blatantly absurd ideas until well past 3 in the morning. The cabin door was ajar all night, several passengers and the occasional conductor passed by. I believe Ms. Gibb rushed by around 12:30 AM, sometime just before Conductor Stoker returned to announce the derailment. Katherine Rand Race Elf Age 40 Occupation Governess Cabin B1 Reason for Travel New job opportunities at Blackpoint Keywords Efficient, Hardworking, Cool Under Pressure Bio A strict governess, Katherine has tried to escape a sordid past as a dishonorably discharged draftee. She's relied on a new name and an adopted identity to ensure she can find jobs as a governess. She is trying to move westward where it is less likely she will be recognized and revealed. Secret She was dishonorably discharged from the Army for getting romantically involved with a superior officer (Col. Labey), and failing to disclose his identity when investigated. Alibi She was beyond Pinkerton's suite at the time of the murders. Notable Noticeably clever, Shuts fown all talk of herself immediately. Right Handed. Testimony I was in my quarters with Elsa until she was recalled by the MEP. I didn't leave all night. Luther Lette Race Gnome Age 45 Occupation Secretary (to Forbes) Cabin A11 Reason for Travel Accompanying Forbes Keywords Young, Inexperienced, A Little Brash Bio Luther Lette was a promising law student, but his excessive love for inebriating drinks caused the University to expell him. He has taken odd secretarial jobs ever since to make ends meet. Secret Lette has been embezzling from Forbes for the past year, both out of greed and out of hatred, as he knows Forbes killed George Pabst on purpose. Alibi He was with Col. Labey all throughout the night of the murder. Notable Wears spectacles. A closer examination reveals they are very expensive. Right Handed Testimony Colonel Labey and I had a discussion that went really late, or really early depending on how you look at it. I think we finally finished our bottles around 3:30 AM. I remember looking at my timepiece and thinking Mr. Forbes is going to kill me for showing up hung over. Guess I had the right idea but the wrong victim. I think I saw Ms. Gibb shortly before and after Stoker walked by. Merl Pinkerton Race Tiefling (Red) Age 49 Occupation Salesman (Private Eye) Cabin A9 Reason for Travel Business (Hired by Forbes) Keywords Loud, Flamboyant, Persuasive (Cool, Collected) Bio The son of a decorated Gendarme Detective, Merl decided at an early age not to follow directly in his father's gootsteps, and instead launched an early form of the private detective agency. He is well known among the Gendarme as an expert sleuth, but has managed to keep his name relatively well hidden from the general consciousness. Secret Pinkerton is secretly working for Forbes, both as hired security as well as to help Forbes discover who has been stealing from him. He suspects Lette, but has not confronted the Gnome. Alibi He was hired to protect Forbes. He stood guard with Stoker after Georgina was \"attacked\", and Cochran will vouch for his good character. Notable Looks like the quintessential door-to-door salesman. Slight bulge in his jacket pocket from a lockpick set. Left Handed Testimony I was on the lookout for anyone trying to access the first-class coach. The only people I saw rushing back and forth were the Conductors, Ms. Gibb, Mr. Owl, and Mrs. Mildred. The latter I stopped once it was clear something fishy was going on. I lost track of the Kenku while I was standing guard over Mrs. Pabst. Dr. Abraham Coghill Race Halfling Age 130 Occupation Physician / Apothecary Cabin A10 Reason for Travel Visiting Relatives Keywords Crotchetty, Direct, Secretly Kindhearted Bio Dr. Coghill began his career as an Army medic, but decided to pursue private practice as soon as his enlistment came to an end. He is a respected physician within Siddar circles, and is the Chairman of the Siddar Medical Society. Secret Dr. Coghill has for some time been dependent on a cocktail of muscle relaxants and soporifics in order to sleep. He keeps several vials hidden throughout his person, amongst the dozens of other potions and draughts. Alibi He was knocked out the entire night, and beyond Pinkerton's suite. Notable Carries dozens of little glass vials on him. Right Handed Testimony I was in my quarters all night, having taken a sleeping draught. I didn't even notice the derailment until Mr. Stoker was kind enough to rouse me for breakfast.

Anniversary) Keywords Refined, Menacing, Sour Bio The owner of several smaller distilleries, Forbes' delivery cart accidentally killed George Pabst a little over a year ago. While tragic, the accident had the fortunate consequence that it gave Forbes an opportunity to meet, and later marry, Georgina Pabst and her not inconconsequential fortune and social status. Secret Forbes' real name is Cyril Weddal, a known racketeer and criminal. He murdered George Pabst in order to rid himself of a potential financial problem, and took advantage of his widow's grief to inject himself into her life and grant his cover businesses an air of respectability. Alibi He was killed first. Notable Gives off bad vibes to a lot of people. Wears fine clothing, but it feels wrong on him. Autopsy Time of Death : 11 PM to 2 AM, hard to tell due to the cold Cause of Death : 7 stab wounds to the abdomen Notes : Appears to have been done with a common knife by a left-handed assailant. There is evidence of a single, right-handed blow, but it is inconclusive. Georgina Pabst Race Dwarf Age 120 Occupation Housewife, Mother, Confidant, Chef, Therapist, and whatever else strikes her mood. Cabin A2 Reason for Travel Vacation (1 yr. Anniversary) Keywords Talkative, Round, Short, Henish Bio Widowed twice and remarried thrice, Mrs. Pabst is a chatterbox of the worst kind. She constantly talks over everyone, regaling anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in her sights with inane stories about her daughter and her former and current husbands. Despite everything, she is a good natured person at heart, and has been called \"The Unsinkable Mrs. Pabst\" both due to her tenaciousness as well as her \"buoyant\" personality. Secret Mrs. Pabst learned that Forbes killed her previous husband on purpose, and has been plotting revenge for some time now. She conspired with Iris to rid each other of their mutual problems while on the Express. Alibi She was attacked and knocked unconsciouss during the murders. Notable Huge Personality, Bright Red Hair, Loud, Talktative, Right Handed Testimony I was in my compartment, when all of a sudden I woke up due to the sound of a door being opened, you know just like in those horror shellackies that are all the rage nowadays. I just knew a man had come into my chamber, and don't give me that look I know precisely what the feeling of a man in my chambers is! I felt a bump on my head and I when I finally came to I panicked and rang for Mr. Stalker. He took for absolutely ever and then had the gall to suggest I dreamt it up! I've never been so insulted in my life, I have half a mind to write a sternly worded letter to the Director of the Trans-Siddar's wife! Nanie Hays Race Kenku Age 62 Occupation Missionary, Former Nurse Cabin B6 Reason for Travel Pilgrimage Keywords Sheepish, Foreign (Far West), Easily Embarrassed Bio A nurse by vocation, Haws was drawn to the simple life of a nun for Mother Church after a particularly devastating outbreak of influenza. She moved to Ichorburn, the distant capital of Mother Church in Mountaincross Province, but has since returned East to spread the faith. Secret She knows Dr. Coghill's drug problem, but does not want to shame him by revealing it. Alibi She was beyond Pinkerton's suite. Notable Nun's Habit, Poor command of the language (Kenku) Testimony Hays was in her compartment all night, and can vouch that Mildred was up knitting and walking around most of the night. She didn't mind, but it did keep her up. Mat Stoker Race Firbolg Age 120 Occupation Conductor ( Quicksilver ) Cabin C2 Reason for Travel ICSC Employee Keywords Respectable, Honest, Lacking Brains Bio A pleasant and perpetually cheerful man, Stoker has no ambitions beyond being the face of the Stonhyr Express' most prestigious accomodations. He is extremely proud of his job and his spotless record. Secret None Alibi He was in the locomotive with Cochran and the engineers at the time of the murder. He stood guard with Pinkerton till morning after Mrs. Pabst reported being attacked. Notable Conductor's Uniform. Left Handed Testimony I was in the engine with Wrigth, Cochran, and the engineers until around 12:40 AM I did pop by the cars for a brief moment to let everyone know of the derailment, but then I went right back. I think it was around 12:30 AM. After that, I went back around 12:45 AM, and it wasn't until 1:10 AM that Mr. Forbes accidentally rang for me. Then it was quiet until Mrs. Pabst had her incident around 1:30 AM. I know someone was in the forward lavatory while I was guarding Mrs. Pabst. I went to investigate since they were in there a long time, and I got a response, but when I overrode the lock there was no one in there, and a small puddle of water had formed beneath the window. Rush Wright Race Tiefling (Black) Age 27 Occupation Conductor ( Midnight Sun ) Cabin C3 Reason for Travel ICSC Employee Keywords Tomboyish, Informal, Vigilant Bio Unlike Stoker, Rush considers her current position as the #2 Conductor of the Express to be a stepping stone to bigger and better things. She has her eyes set on the Directorship, and she's not afraid to let anyone know of her ambitions. She is a little tomboyish, spurring the more form-fitting women's skirt for the male trousers, and the ascott for a tie. Secret None Alibi She was in the aft cars at the time of the crime, covering for another conductor who got hurt during the derailment. Several passengers saw her throughout the night and will attest to the excellent service she rendered even to \"Coach\" class riders. Notable Fiery yellow eyes and a constant predatory smirk. She is sometimes mistaken for a man due to her more masculine clothing choices. Testimony I was in the engine with Cochran, Stoker, and the engineers, till I was sent to the aft cars to relieve another conductor whohad gotten hurt. I didn't really see anything. You can ask around, all the aft cars passengers saw me. Thaddeus Dunn Race Elf Age 440 Occupation Valet (Forbes) Cabin B9 Reason for Travel Accompanying Forbes and Mrs. Pabst Keywords Dour, Grave, Disapproving, Reserved Bio Dunn does not talk much about himself or his past. He was raised by a very traditional family who taught him the importance of decorum and ritual despite their low social status. Dunn believes that it is his duty to serve his employer, and keep any thoughts or judgement to himself. he has a distaste for non-Elves, but it is borne out of a perceived lack of decorum. Secret Dunn knows Pinkerton's true identity, and has knowledge of many of Forbes' lesser criminal activities (tax evasion, fraud, etc.) Alibi He was kept awake by Uleaven's illness all night. Notable Bowler hat and very formal clothes with gloves. Right Handed. Testimony One was kept up all night by that oafish brute and his sensitive stomach.

He left a threatening note, meaning only to upset Forbes. Alibi He was sick and kept Dunn up all night. Notable Loud, Bright Clothing, Always talking about how great Siddar and the Republic are. Testimony I was sick, something about lunch just didn't sit well with me. That Dunn guy, the butler, no sympathy for others. Kept complaining I kept him up all night, he could have just offered a little sympathy. I heard Forbes was dirty, involved in all kinds of illegal gambling and fight rigging. Plus, his alcohol wasn't all that good, I wonder how he got so rich so quickly. Elsa Gibb Race Tabaxi Age 32 Occupation Maid (MEP Learmonth) Cabin B5 Reason for Travel Accompanying MEP Learmonth Keywords Dependable, Trustworthy, Unimaginative Bio Orphaned at a young age, Gibb was afforded only a basic education. scraping together enough funds to attend finishing school, Gibb was hired by MEP Learmonth during one of her re-election campaigns, and has been with the grand old dame ever since.

Testimony I was with my Lady since Mr. Stoker came to fetch me. She had a terrible fright, and she enjoys hearing me read. It was strange through, Mr. Stoker was in such a rush when he came to get me, and then he was just strolling along like nothing a few minutes later when I nearly bumped into him going into my Lady's room. He looked really frightened. MEP Filomena Learmonth Race Human Age 76 Occupation Member-Elector of Parliament (Blackpoint District) Cabin A4 Reason for Travel Returning for General Elections Keywords Toadlike, Elderly, Dignified, Iron Willed Bio A distinguished parliamentarian, MEP Learmonth has served for over 50 years, earning a well-deserved reputation as an iron-willed, shrewd, and dignified diplomat and politician. She is known among her supporters and detractors alike as \"The Iron Toad\", much to her great displeasure. Secret She has promised to help Iris stay in the Republic, but she is facing a tough re-election campaign and does not want the scandal of the murders to tarnish her hard-earned reputation. Alibi She was with Gibbs throughout the night in her quarters. She is too weak to have dealt the death blows to Forbes. Notable She wears a large red sash with gold embroidery reading \"Member Elector of Parliament\" that is almost as large as she is Testimony I was in my cabin when the train derailed. Conductor Stoker was kind enough to check in on me, and went to get Ms. Gibb to keep me company. We spent all night reading The Collected Fables of Mary the Prophetess, childish I know but I've had a weakness for it since I was a child. Iris Keogh Race Half-Elf Age 80 Occupation None Cabin A6 Reason for Travel Returning to Anacreon Keywords Exotic, Beautiful, Charming Accent Bio The daughter of a minor aristocratic family in Anacreon, Iris always resented that her only worth was as a potential bride to richer and more powerful families.

Mat Stoker saw her drink one such vial the night of the murder, but unbeknownst to him, it was a fake. Notable Olive skin tone, Finest Siddar clothing. Left Handed. Testimony I was asleep all night, due to the sleeping draught Dr. Cochran gave me. I must admit I'm glad I slept through it all, it must have been terribly frightening.

He has been abusive towards Iris behind closed doors, and while he is known to have a temper, the full extent has been suppressed.

Day 1, 10:30 PM - Supper Service Iris and Dr. Cochran sit together. Iris discusses her restlessness and lack of sleep aboard trains. Dr. Cochran gives her a sleeping draught. Lige sits with them. MEP Learmonth and Elsa Gibb are absent. They are in the MEP's compartment. The MEP enjoys listening to Gibb read before going to bed. Cochran sits alone, but welcomes company. He will discuss the company's past, and will answer any questions about the line or the company. Pabst, Hays, and Forbes sit together. Pabst tells inane stories. Pabst will \"kidnap\" any player she fancies and forces them to dine with her. She reveals readily that she is on her first year anniversary, and that her previous husband was killed in an accident with Forbes' delivery wagon. She further reveals that Forbes came to call on her daily shortly after the accident, eventually leading to their marriage. Lige and Forbes stare daggers at each other the entire supper from across separate tables. Pinkerton is absent from dinner. He is inspecting Forbes' compartment while everyone is distracted. He will then do a run of the train to check for known faces in the other cars. Lette and Dunn sit alone in silence. They will not offer much conversation. Mat Stoker and Rush Wright will be transferring baggage to the baggage car as requested, and will otherwise return to their compartment during supper. Forbes, Lette, and Dunn leave early to review earnings documents in Forbes' compartment. Iris will leave early to discuss asylum with the MEP under the guise of a social visit. Day 2, 3:30 AM - Arrival at Glacierheart The following passengers board at this station: Group 1 Katherine Rand Col. Isham Labey Group 2 Otis Uleaven Uleaven will accidentally hop in the wrong bunk and startle Dunn. They do not enjoy each other's company. Day 2, 8:30 AM - Breakfast Service Iris and Pabst dine together, and bond over their shared love of the Republic's greater freedoms. They will shortly retire to the observation car to discuss their mutual marriage problems and concoct the murder plot. The women will make polite conversation, but will make it clear they wish to be alone. Rand and Labey eat in tense silence across a pair of adjacent tables. They will not offer much conversation. Coghill and Hays exchange medical stories, with the former starting to get the hang of deciphering the latter's sounds into something resembling speech. Pinkerton searches Uleaven's quarters with Dunn, as both suspect that the Half-Orc is clearly a hired goon in a ridiculous disguise. They will find nothing. Uleaven tries to rope Lige into a joint business venture, but the latter will tersely decline, citing the impropriety of it. Uleaven will finish breakfast with Cochran if possible, discussing their shared admiration of the wonders of steam. Lette and Forbes will pour over financial records all throughout breakfast. MEP Learmonth and Gibbs will eat together, with the latter ordering complicated special requests. The MEP and Gibbs will discuss the Blackpoint situation and the upcoming General Election. Stoker and Wright are off duty during breakfast. Day 2, 11:30 AM - Arrival at Featherfurth If the players look like they are having trouble, or aren't in a good position to unravel the mystery, the following passenger can board at this station: Hercules Parr\u00f3t He is a celebrated actor who often portrays detectives. He is a tool for the GM to point the party in a particular direction, either by actually helping or by being so clearly incompetent that nothing he says can possibly be accurate, thereby steering the party away from a particular fruitless line. Day 2, 12:30 PM - Lunch Service Iris and MEP Learmonth sit together and discuss the Republic. Gibb sits with them but doesn't contribute much. Rand, Hays, and Cochran are held hostage to Mrs. Pabst's conversation. Forbes and Lette take a break. Forbes and Dunn dine in silence. Lette joins Lige and Labey. Uleaven leaves early, complaining of abdominal pain. Coghill will follow him shortly after summoning Stoker to fetch his medical kit. Lige and Labey have an argument, causing Lige to storm off. The argument is spurred by the two parties' drasticly different interpretation of the \"natural order\". Lette and Labey hit it off pretty well, despite some disagreements. Day 2, 5:00 PM - Delay At a signal junction, the Express is sidelined to make way for a barging troop transport. The junction flags indicate that there has been a monster attack down the line, and military necessities trump passanger services. Day 2, 5:30 PM - Dinner Service The Express is still sidelined until the line is cleared. Forbes and Pabst dine with Lige and Iris. They have a hushed conversation where Lige and Forbes agree to meet at around 1:30 AM to settle the outstanding gambling debts. MEP Learmonth and Dr. Coghill dine, and discuss their shared interest in Iris' wellbeing, albeit in polite and hushed tones so as not to be overheard. Uleaven is missing. Stoker and Coghill will affirm that Uleaven is sick and resting in his berth. Rand and Labey are in the observation car, pretending not to know one another while carrying on a tense conversation. They are not doing a good job of pretending. Lette and Dunn dine in silence. Cochran, Stoker, and Wright are in the baggage car with the other conductors, discussing the delay and how it will impact the train's timetable. Hays dines alone, but she seems unfazed by it. Pinkerton is absent, as it is becoming increasingly common. He is searching Lette's room, and has found evidence that it is Letter that is stealing from Forbes. He also finds evidence that Forbes killed George Pabst over a business dispute. He will not reveal his findings to Forbes, as he needs time to decide whether he's working for the right person or not. Forbes, Lette, and Dunn will stay in the Restaurant car until suppertime, going over paperwork. Day 2, 7:00 PM - All Clear The flags are updated as the line is finally cleared. The Express resumes its journey. Cochran has ordered the engineers to try to make up time, and open up the throttle. The weather has taken a turn for the worse though, and a heavy blizzard is descending upon the area. Stoker and Wright inform the passengers of the new timetable, and offer some complimentary hot drinks. Day 2, 10:30 PM - Supper Service Pabst and Hays are missing. They are chatting in Hays' room, and snacking on some cheese and bread brought by Wright. Lette, Dunn, and Forbes continue to go over documents. Learmonth and Iris sit at a far table and discuss the mechanisms of asylumn in general terms. Rand and Labey share a light snack in the observation car. They haven't left since dinner. Pinkerton pays Uleaven a visit to try to pump him for information under the guise of a friendly visit. He discounts the sick Half-Orc as a threat, and gives him some contacts that could be useful in Blackpoint as an apology for wasting his time. Coghill retrieves a new batch of sleeping draughts from his private locker in the baggage car. He visibly takes one before leaving the restaurant car, but if asked will claim to have had a headache. Back at the He also hands one vial to Stoker and asks him to deliver it to Iris later that evening when she retires. Lige is in his room, fuming. Cochran is making the rounds along the train, thanking all the passengers for their patience and offering apologies for the delay. Forbes orders a coffee to be brought to him at 11:30 PM, to his compartment. Day 2, 11:20 PM - The Plot is Executed Iris will leave early, and receive the draught from Stoker. She asks him to bring her some water, and while he is gone, swaps the draught with a placebo. She drinks the fake potion in front of him when he returns. Pabst will return to her compartment before the end of supper, where she picks up a draught Iris left in the end priv. She returns to the restaurant car and orders a warm milk, and while the attendant is distracted, spikes the readied coffee for Forbes. If for some reason she is caught, she will claim that she is only doing it to make sure Forbes gets some sleep, as he has been staying up all night to go over paperwork. Stoker picks up the coffee and delivers it not a few moments later. Forbes will quickly down the cup and notice nothing. Lette and Dunn will be dismissed by Forbes as the latter wants some privacy to review some of the less-than-legal business books. He will quickly find himself overcome with exhaustion, but given his lack of sleep recently he won't find it too suspicious. He'll decide to take a short nap as the sleeping draught hits him. On his way back, Lette runs into Labey and Rand, who are returning from the Observation Car. Lette invites Labey to discuss politics. The dragonborn accepts and bids Rand a polite goodbye. Day 3, 12:00 AM - The Express Derails As the blizzard rages on, the Express hits a snowbank that has built up on the rails. Although the snow gives, it lifts and halts the train, causing the engine to derail. The passengers will feel a harsh deceleration. Some people will receive minor bumps and bruises, and a few will get more serious injuries, often from falling or being struck by a heavy object knocked loose. Stoker and Wright will check on the passengers in the cars, and being making announcements of another delay while the state of the Express is examined. Before Stoker heads to the locomotive, MEP Learmonth will summon him, and ask him to fetch Gibb. He wakes her and transmits the message before heading to the engine at 12:15 AM with Cochran. Wright heads to the other passenger cars to take over for a conductor who was struck by a heavy suitcase and needs to rest. Day 3, 12:25 AM - The First Murder Iris uses her minor magical training to disguise herself as Stoker, and dons a stolen Conductor's uniform. She accidentally bumps into Gibb as the latter reports to Learmonth's cabin. At 12:25 AM, Stoker returns from the locomotive and announces that the train has derailed. He announces it to the various compartments, and excuses himself to continue assessing the damage. Going through the connecting door in Pabst's room, Iris enters Forbes' compartment, and finds him unconscious. She stabs Forbes several times at 12:26 AM. She opens the window, hoping to confuse the investigation. She then hides the knife in the compartment after wiping it down. At 12:28 AM, she crosses the connecting door again and leaves. She returns to her compartment after hiding the stolen uniform in an empty compartment (only if Hercules Parr\u00f3t is not aboard, otherwise she will hide the uniform in Gibb's room). Day 3, 1:05 AM - The Second Murder Lige leaves his room to talk to Forbes and settle the debts. He slips into the dark cabin, and discovers the body when he opens the Ichor lamp shutters. He knows that he will be implicated, and decides to steal and destroy any evidence of his debt before leaving. At 1:10 AM, Stoker accidentally rings the conductor's bell. Stoker, who had recently returned, answers, but is told by Lige (pretending to be Forbes) it was a mistake. At 1:26 AM, Lige accidentally triggers a Glyph of Warding, which activates a Scorching Ray spell that kills him. At 1:30 AM, after hearing the Glyph go off, Pabst frantically rings the bell, claiming that she felt a man in her compartment. Stoker attempts to calm her down, and tries to fetch Dr. Coghill without success (the Dr. is knocked out by his sleeping draught). Pinkerton notices the worried conductor, and joins him to stand guard outside Mrs. Pabst's door until morning. Day 3, 9:00 AM - The Discovery When Lette and Dunn are unable to rouse Forbes for breakfast, they fetch Stoker Cochran, and Coghill, and use the Conductor's key to open the compartment. They are shocked to discover the two bodies, and the investigation begins.","title":"Murder on the Stonhyr Express"},{"location":"MurderOnTheStonhyrExpress/#murder-on-the-stonhyr-express","text":"","title":"Murder On The Stonhyr Express"},{"location":"MurderOnTheStonhyrExpress/#description","text":"The Stonhyr Express is the premier rail service between Siddar City and Blackpoint at the tail end of the 8th Century AGS.
