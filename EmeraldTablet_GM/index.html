<hr />
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The Emerald Tablets are a pentad of artifacts from before the First Age, which were themselves part of a terrible weapon that could level a city in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and craftsmen of today.</p>
<p>It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord.</p>
<p>As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon, they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival.</p>
<p>The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Random First Age Treasure</p>
<p>First Age materials for use with Azoth's enchantment circle, or sold at a high
profit on the Siddar/Blackpoint markets. To this end, the party should be
encouraged to thoroughly search and explore the area.</p>
<p>Note that the random treasure tables on this sheet typically do not specify a
quantity. For example, searching through Arkala may yield "Ruined Book or
Manuscript", but it would be strange for the entire town to possess only a single
damaged book.  You may roll multiple times on the treasure tables to generate
additional treasures, and you may roll to determine the quantity of each treasure
that is generated.</p>
<p>Treasure comes in various "grades":  </p>
<ul>
<li>Ruined / Rusted / Shattered</li>
<li>Good / Acceptable / Damaged</li>
<li>Excellent / Intact</li>
<li>Unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Treasure Quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruined : 4d6</li>
<li>Good : 1d8</li>
<li>Excellent : 1d2 (or just 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unique treasure is usually a magic item or a named item, either directly
granted by the table or rolled on one of the Magic Item Tables from the DMG.
These can be things like "+" weapons, armor, and ammo, magic wands, magic
scrolls, potions, and named magic items.        </p>

<h2 id="reaching-the-ophidian-valley">Reaching the Ophidian Valley</h2>
<p>The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere.</p>
<p>Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage, only half return alive.</p>
<h3 id="serpents-pass">Serpent's Pass</h3>
<p>The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass, an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls levied at Ravenhelm.</p>
<p>The highway is well traveled, and both the Expedition and the Dusk Templars routinely patrol the area. Merchant caravans are routinely encountered, providing an opportunity for trade and resupply before heading out into the unclaimed wilderness.</p>
<h3 id="lashend-road-fork">Lashend Road Fork</h3>
<p>From the Serpent's Pass within the valley forks the Lashend Road, the old highway that leads to Terraworth and the South March Province. The fork has been barricaded off, with dozens of hazard signs in all languages warning travelers to the dangers beyond. Unlike the Serpent's Pass, Lashend Road is not patrolled and has fallen victim to disuse and disrepair for centuries.</p>
<p>Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs, the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded, forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be necessary to avoid getting lost.</p>
<h3 id="lashend-river">Lashend River</h3>
<p>The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city. One of Baltatrax's first moves was to block and dam the river's source, knowing fully well that the city would collapse much more quickly as a result. Today, the river is but a small stream running through a dry, rocky riverbed.</p>
<p>As the river is one of the only sources of clean water in the area, it tends to attract all manner of creatures, including the monsters that inhabit the area. The table below contains possible encounters for the party as they travel along the Lashend Road.</p>

<h2 id="towns-of-terraworth">Towns of Terraworth</h2>
<p>Like any major city, Terraworth was supported by a network of smaller towns and villages that supplied much of the food and raw materials needed by the city.</p>
<p>These abandoned villages often hide minor relics of the First Age, which can fetch a decent price on the artifacts market. Small icons and statues of the Old Gods are the most common relic, but once in a blue moon a lucky hunter finds a wondrous item that still holds a bit of magic.</p>

<h3 id="arkala-ruins">Arkala Ruins</h3>
<p>The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was quickly evacuated.</p>
<p>Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest. Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins.</p>
<p>As the party passes by Arkala, they can discover that a small group of amateur relic hunters are currently under attack in Arkala.</p>
<p>If it is nighttime when the party passes by Arkala, a faint blue-green glow can be seen emanating from the town, interspersed with the occassional flash of energy. The faint sounds of clashing metal and energetic blasts can be heard with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>If it is daytime, a plume of black some can be seen rising into the air from the direction of Arkala, and the same Wisdom (Perception) check can be used to hear the sounds of combat.</p>
<h3 id="ambush-in-arkala">Ambush in Arkala</h3>
<p>As Terraworth is the nearest and least dangerous major ruin of the First Age, it is a popular spot for novice treasure hunters to cut their teeth before heading out into the true dangers of the South March and Southguard Provinces.</p>
<p>On this occasion, a pair of prospective adventurers is under attack in Arkala. Leighya Treadway and Arther Bramer, natives of Lindmont to the Southeast of Archersreve, are fending off a group of monsters consisting of:</p>
<pre><code>* 4 x Skeleton
* 2 x Will-o'-Wisp
* 1 x Poltergeist
* 1 x Deathlock Wight
</code></pre>
<p>The pair, as experienced former Republic soldiers, are holding out among the ruins of the town, but are running out of ammunition and won't hold out for much longer.</p>
<p>If the party decides not to investigate Arkala, the encounter above is skipped, and the amateur hunters will be encountered later, but missing much of their prepared equipment and information, having been forced to leave it all behind when escaping Arkala.</p>
<h3 id="novice-adventurers">Novice Adventurers</h3>
<p>Leighya and Arther, fresh out of a conscription stint with the Army of the Republic, decided not to extend their warrants but rather to strike it out on their own. The two childhood friends have always been enamored with stories of daring explorers recovering ancient relics, and resolved to make those dreams come true.</p>
<p>The pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers. They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth revealing a long lost treasure. Over the last 6 months, after their deployment with the Republic Army, the two have gathered as much information about Terraworth as possible, and posses highly detailed copies of maps from the Royal Archives in Blackpoint, belived to be the best available. They also carry all manner of adventuring gear, from hundreds of feet of rope to pickaxes to ichor (flameless) lamps. They also had a horse-drawn cart, which has long gone missing after the horse fled the ambush, taking the heavier equipment with it.</p>
<p>Despite all their preparation and combat training, the pair were shocked at the strength and ferocity of the attack upon them. According to their research, a few skeletons or possibly a wisp or two should have been the worst thing they could encounter. The two are further convinced that something really must have awoken within the city ruins, and are more determined than ever to find out.</p>
<p>If the pair is rescued from the ambush in Arkala, they will reluctantly offer their support and vast knowledge of the city to the party, in exchange for a mutually-beneficial combined expedition.</p>
<p>If the pair is encountered later on, they will make the same offer, but will only have their memorized knowledge available, as the maps and notes were destroyed when they were forced to flee Arkala. Some details will be missing, but between the pair they can remember every major step and landmark along their planned route.</p>
<p>Regardless of how they are met, the pair will guide the party deep into the ruins of Terraworth, into what used to be the governmental district. Based on the information they've collected in the past several months indicates that there is a previously undiscovered vault beneath the Imperial Archives, which could hold untold riches.</p>
<p>After a few hours together, the party will eventually notice that Leighya has been extremely careful when handling a small satchel. A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check can allow the party to hear a faint rasping sound coming from within the sack, which quickly prompts Arther to gently pat the bag unconciously.</p>
<p>If pressed, Arther and Leighya will try to avoid the subject, claiming that the satchel simply holds some delicate supplies (ointments, antiseptics, etc.). If pressed further to reveal the contents, they will claim that the contents are very sensitive and expensive. Both statements are clearly false, and it is obvious that the pair don't want to reveal the true contents of the bag.</p>
<p>If confronted or otherwise forced to open the satchel, Arther and Leighya will begrudgingly comply, warning the party to listen to him and not make any hasty decisions. Gingerly reaching into the pouch, Arthur repeatedly tells the party to stay calm as he reveals an ancient-looking skull, meticulously adorned with holy sigils and purity seals. As the skull is pulled out of the satchel, an ominous amber light begins to glow from within the eyesockets, and with a deep, rasping breath the skull is momentarily sheathed in green flames - a Flameskull!</p>
<h3 id="flameskull">Flameskull</h3>
<p>As the flameskull awakens, it's clear that the charms and icons are somehow keeping it from flying into the psychotic frenzy that traditionally characterizes the creature. As the flames once again flicker on and off,  the skull rasps <em>"Help me..."</em></p>
<p>It's clear from the way that Arther and Leighya look and behave towards the flameskull that they have some emotional connection with it, possibly a combination of pity and sadness.</p>
<p>If the party does not immediately attack and asks the pair to explain, Leighya will respond with their story.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>We found him on our last mission. Our squad was sent to Terraworth to
rescue some clueless merchants that were trying to find a shortcut to
Rookwatch and got ambushed outside the ruins.</p>
<p>He was just wandering aimlessly outside Arkala, cackling madly to itself
every so often before crying out in anguish. We were just about to put
an arrow through it when it suddenly turned and dashed towards us. I thought
we were in for it when fire shot out from it's eyes, but instead of attacking
us it hit the skeleton that had managed to sneak up behind us.</p>
<p>I still remember the first words it said, <em>"Please, help me. I don't know
what I am."</em> Then it just swung violently between fits of laughter and
despair. We didn't know what to do, but we had a cleric, Sister Powall,
she said he might be remembering his former life. He'd just saved mine,
I felt we owed it to him to try to help.</p>
</div>
<p>Leighya will continue explaining that the charms and sigils help calm it, almost like a sleeping trance. They've managed to talk to flameskull when it has a rare moment of lucidity, and have learned a little bit about the pitiful creature they now care for:</p>
<pre><code>* **Former Life.** The flameskull can remember very little about itself,
only a momentary flash of a warrior in gleaming armor, perhaps a paladin.


* **How it Died.** The last image the creature can remember is of a sickening
green pulse of energy consuming all of its vision.


* **Who Created It.** In undeath, the flameskull can remember things more
vividly. It recalls being called to this life by a black-robed cultist,
whose skin looked badly lesioned, as though he'd been severely burnt.


* **Why it Behaves Strangely.** For months, the skull had obeyed its
creator, all the while screaming internally and descending into madness
over the atrocities it was forced to commit. He'd been shattered at some
point during a fight with soldiers. He remembers a cleric, perhaps something
he did had broken the cultist's control, at least partially.

<h3 id="terraworth-loop">Terraworth Loop</h3>
<p>At the third fork in the road on the way to Terraworth lies a loop that connects many of the surrounding town ruins with the city proper. The lower path leads to an abandoned Imperial outpost and the city of Terraworth, while the upper path leads to Krutoq's Tower and the supporting towns.</p>
<h3 id="cardend-and-falkirk">Cardend and Falkirk</h3>
<p>Cardend and Falkirk are the two principal agricultural towns that once fed the massive populace of Terraworth. Like Arkala, the towns have been picked dry of any major First Age relics, leaving only the occasional rusted trinket.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a band of monsters (from the table of Lashend River encounters) will take up temporary residence within the town ruins. It's clear that many prospective relic hunters have met their fate in these towns, as dessicated or skeletal remains can easily be found amongst the rubble. Basic adventuring supplies (rope, water bags, picks, torches, etc.) can be recovered from the remains.</p>
<h3 id="kirkwall-ruins">Kirkwall Ruins</h3>
<p>The mining town of Kirkwall stood to the far Northeast of Terraworth. The town was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was processed in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks of silver ore can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in hauling the heavy rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting.</p>
<p>To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining complex, which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is rumored that the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to meet an untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most relic hunters avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation as well as a measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within.</p>
<p>The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle. Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within the debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma.</p>
<p>Further investigation of the debris reveals that the equipment is a hodgepodge of pieces from both the First and Second Ages. Smithing touchmarks range from the forges of Terraworth to the manufactoria of Siddar City. A DC 18 Intelligence (History) check can reveal that the tooling marks on the Siddarese weapons are of a factory-forge that was only opened (with much fanfare) within the past decade. Additionally, a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check shows that the corpses are significantly older, with many showing clear signs of weathering and erosion to a degree that would indicate hundreds of years of exposure rather than the less-than-ten years some of the weapons would suggest.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent contradiction, both timelines are correct. A battle did take place approximately 4 years prior, between the creatures living within the mines and a skeletal army of an Elumin (Death domain) cleric, Pleas Morgan.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="krutoq-the-elven-lich">Krutoq the Elven Lich</h2>
<p>Elandorr Krutoq, former Councillor of Terraworth, was an elven wizard from around 400 BGS. As Krutoq neared the end of his life, he became obsessed with the possibility of achieving immortality. Though very little is known about that time period, it is believed that Krutoq used his position and power to ensure his activities would not be halted. Indeed, Krutoq succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to convert the City's population into an undead army as payment to his fiendish patron.</p>
<p>For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he had built ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious purposes. Krutoq was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery was never found. Given his high position within the city's government, Elandorr had successfully hidden his phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly that it would remain undisturbed until he could regenerate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection, leaving him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath. Should the phylactery be removed from the protection of the vault however, Krutoq would arise once again to a world without the Imperial might that once defeated him.</p>
<h3 id="pleas-morgan">Pleas Morgan</h3>
<p>Formerly a member of Blackpoint's clergy under the Primate, Pleas was drawn by the proscribed teachings of the dark side of Elumin, and was ejected from the priesthood for it. Pleas would have been executed for blasphemy, had he not been spirited away by like-minded cultists seeking his intimate knowledge of Blackpoint's ecclesiarchy.</p>
<p>Morgan, acting on his twisted interpretation of Elumin's will, is attempting to locate Krutoq's phylactery within the ruins of Terraworth to revive the fallen lich. It is due to his efforts that rumors of an awakening in Terraworth have begun circulating the relic hunter community. Pleas, having been granted visions of a golden vault beneath Terraworth, is consumed with restoring the ancient lich.</p>
<h3 id="krutoqs-tower">Krutoq's Tower</h3>
<p>To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses.</p>
<p>Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower.</p>
<p>At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper floors.</p>
<p>The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held together by the barest of threads.</p>
<p>Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land seem to avoid the tower. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check will find a forgotten satchel in the barracks that looks too new to be from the First Age. Inside the satchel, some minor rations and supplies can be found, but the only thing of interest is a notebook filled with incomprehensible symbols. A DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check is needed to decipher some of the journal. One page near the end has a map, but it is unlabeled and too low scale to figure out immediately. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check will allow the characters to realize that the map is of the former city of Terraworth.</p>

<h2 id="city-of-terraworth">City of Terraworth</h2>
<p>Once a great Imperial Free City, Terraworth was one of the first major cities to fall to Baltatrax's hordes during the period known as the Great Sack. In the rising turmoil of the collapse of the Empire, Terraworth found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the newly risen kingdoms and city states to the South, making it a tempting target for the Demon Lord's first major conquest.</p>
<h3 id="terraworth-outskirts">Terraworth Outskirts</h3>
<p>Like all great cities, Terraworth's growing population quickly outgrew the confines of the original walled city, leading to sprawling urban centers beyond the city walls. These outskirts, consisting primarily of lower class housing and industry, did not fare well under the onslaught of Baltatrax's attack, nor in the five centuries of abandonment that followed. In some sections, there is not a single standing building, with only foundations and partially buried rubble to indicate where a structure once stood.</p>
<p>Many parts of the outskirts show weathered signs of fire damage, with the occasional mangled and rusted sword or speartip still embedded in an uncollapsed wall. The outskirts of the city are perilous for the inexperienced. Structures collapse with only the slightest disturbance, causing tons of rubble to fall on anyone unfortunate enough to be within. If a building collapses on someone, they can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to throw themselves under cover. On a failed check they take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on a successful check.</p>
<p>One of the more recognizable sites on the city outskirts are the old Imperial Army Training Grounds. Although no structures remain, the large parade grounds are a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>Based on their experience with the Expedition, Leighya will suggest that the training grounds may hold hidden underground caches of weapons and supplies. Indeed, a handful of caches lie exposed where treasure hunters have stumbled upon one. If Leighya has the Royal Archive maps, a pair of caches can be found easily. Without the maps, a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to find each of two caches.</p>
<p>Each cache contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>One dozen mundane melee and ranged weapons</li>
<li>One dozen armor pieces of mixed type</li>
<li>Roll once on the
    <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#TreasureTables">Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5-10 Table in the DMG</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The outskirts are occasionally patrolled by Pleas' minions. At least one of the creatures will attempt to flee and alert his master to the intruders. If the minion manages to evade the party, encounters within the city are reinforced.</p>

<h3 id="outer-city-districts">Outer City Districts</h3>
<p>The once mighty walls of Terraworth have been breached in several places, and the massive battering ram used by Baltatrax lies in ruins at the broken gate. The buildings directly within the city walls show much the same damage as the buildings outside, and it is clear that a conflagration destroyed much of what the Demon Lord's hordes did not.</p>
<p>The outer districts were primarily slums and industrial areas. The fabled Forges of Terraworth, which once armed and supplied the legions of the Imperial Army, are located in the outer districts. </p>
<p>Most relic hunters who make it past the city walls venture no farther than the massive industrial foundries of the outer districts. The inner city is considered cursed, and recent stories of near-death escapes from terrifying creatures have done nothing to discourage this notion.</p>
<p>The massive forges are known to hold hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of unfinished weapons and blanks. Despite the centuries of pillaging by both the hordes and adventurous relic hunters, it is difficult not to trip over the vast quantity of unfinished materiel in and around the forges. Most of the pieces are mundane and otherwise uninteresting aside from their age, but can fetch a fair price to the right buyers.</p>
<p>The forges are comparatively safe, but if the party spends too long gathering blanks and scrap, there is a good chance that a random patrol will stumble upon them. While the forges are no longer lit, the area still contains several environmental hazards. Large acid vats, once used to clean blanks and stamps, have not lost much potency over the years. Flammeble materials are ubiquitous, and a stray spark or flame can result in lethal detonations.</p>

<p>Beyond the forges lies the ruins of the tenement districts and commercial zones. The districts are largely burnt down, and there's nothing of particular interest within. A few of the remaining buildings contain the lairs of dangerous creatures, and are best avoided. Arther and Leighya will strongly suggest that the party avoid the rest of the Outer Districts.</p>
<h3 id="brass-gates-of-terraworth">Brass Gates of Terraworth</h3>
<p>The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the surrounding ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district was through a set of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than twisted wrecks amidst the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular mindset as the defining line between the comparatively safe outer city and the terrors that lie within the inner city.</p>
<p>The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures, ranging from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences to the collapsed domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored to hold powerful ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure hunters, the inner districts host many dangerous creatures and abominations.</p>
<h3 id="university-of-arcane-sciences">University of Arcane Sciences</h3>
<p>The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The magi of the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and enchantment advances that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the Empire.</p>
<p>The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical laboratories. Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as hands-on workshops for many of the Empire's artificers.</p>
<p>Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out skeleton of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small, dusty calderas. Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was ransacked due to the lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the rest of the University and the surrounding dormitories.</p>
<p>The ruins are sure to contain artifacts buried under tons of rubble. A DC 16 Strength check and at least two hours of hard labor are needed to clear a region large enough to search. A subsequent DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find an artifact within the ruined buildings. Consult the following table for a success.</p>

<h3 id="terraworth-hippodrome">Terraworth Hippodrome</h3>
<p>To the East of the central districts lies the collapsed domes of the Terraworth Hippodrome. The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city, capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles.</p>
<p>In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of cracking and stress.</p>
<p>It is likely that the domes contain large amounts of First Age artifacts and relics, buried beneath the collapsed domes. A DC 17 Strength check is needed in order to clear off the large pieces of debris from an area in order to search. A subsequent successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the party to find interesting objects within the rubble.</p>

<p>The Hippodrome is a dangerous location within Terraworth, primarily due to the instability of the ruins. Most creatures avoid the domes, but if the party has been previously spotted by a patrol, then one of Pleas' patrols may stumble upon them.</p>
<p>Much like an avalanche, any disturbance of the ruins can spell disaster for anyone caught in the region. If the party causes a small disturbance such as loud sounds, strong ground vibrations, explosions, or any result of carelessness or combat, roll 1d20. On a result of 19 - 20, the structure partially collapses. Everyone in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity Saving Throw to avoid being crushed by falling rubble. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save as they dodge the largest pieces.</p>
<p>If a creature inside the dome triggers a partial collapse for any reason, roll 1d10. If the rolled number is less than the number of partial collapses that have occurred, the building fully collapses. Every creature within the structure takes 8d10 bludgeoning damage as the roof collapses.</p>
<h3 id="great-bazaar">Great Bazaar</h3>
<p>The Great Bazaar to the north of the Hippodrome is a large, enclosed forumn that once held the bustling crowds of Terraworth's finest merchants and their customers. The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the invading hordes. Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived buried beneath the wreckage. A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to spot the item within the rubble.
The Bazaar is relatively safe, subject only to the occasional patrol by Pleas' minions.</p>

<h2 id="imperial-forum">Imperial Forum</h2>
<p>The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the Imperial Palace.</p>
<h3 id="city-council-chamber">City Council Chamber</h3>
<p>The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration.</p>
<p>As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives.</p>
<p>The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along with several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements.</p>
<p>The Council Chamber was cursed by Baltatrax after his conquest of the city. Upon entering the structure, a non-evil aligned creature must make a DC 18 Charisma Saving Throw, or gain a madness effect. Roll once on the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness">Long-Term Madness</a> table and apply the effect for 1d10 x 10 hours, or until cured through <em>lesser restoration</em> or <em>remove curse</em>.</p>
<h3 id="basilica">Basilica</h3>
<p>The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline, the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the party, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped off the face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The only visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica floorplan.</p>
<p>There is a hidden entrance to the Basilica Catacombs that has remained undisturbed since before the Great Sack. A DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to find the entrance. A subsequent DC 17 Strength check can force open the sealed entrance, or a DC 16 Intelligence (Religion or History) to deduce the correct unlocking sequence for the Old Pantheon symbols found carved into the stone.</p>
<h3 id="basilica-catacombs">Basilica Catacombs</h3>
<p>The Basilica Catacombs hold the bodies of hundreds of Terraworth's holy figures, including the last Kings and Councillors of their respective eras. The catacombs are relatively small compared to the size of the city, as very few earned the honor of being buried within the hallowed ground.</p>
<p>The catacombs connect via a secret tunnel to the Vault beneath the Imperial Palace. The passage is hidden behind a false burial shelf bearing the inscription 'Elandorr, City Councillor'. The sarcophagus within the shelf is empty and can be pulled away to reveal the passage.</p>
<h3 id="imperial-gardens">Imperial Gardens</h3>
<p>The Imperial Gardens consist of the Imperial Palace and surrounding grounds. The gardens were once a beautifully detailed botanical garden, typically only available to senior government officials and Imperial dignitaries.</p>
<p>The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures, which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The vegetation is overgrown and many of the ground's water features have long since dried up, leaving only the cracked pool floors.</p>
