title : The Emerald Tablets
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Emerald Tablets are a pentad of artifacts from before the First Age, which
    were themselves part of a terrible weapon that could level a city in the blink
    of an eye.


    The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs
    intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands
    of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly
    man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and
    craftsmen of today.


    It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to
    channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous
    system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of
    enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord.


    As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon,
    they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate
    and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival.


    The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell
    early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath
    tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.

    Title : Reaching the Ophidian Valley
    Text : >-
      The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the
      far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after
      civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways
      that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With
      no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying
      hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere.


      Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies
      just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least
      dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and
      only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic
      hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be
      understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage,
      only half return alive.

    Subtitle : Serpent's Pass
    Text : >-
      The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass,
      an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass
      connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls
      levied at Ravenhelm.


      The highway is well traveled, and both the Expedition and the Dusk Templars
      routinely patrol the area. Merchant caravans are routinely encountered,
      providing an opportunity for trade and resupply before heading out into
      the unclaimed wilderness.
  -
    Subtitle : Lashend Road Fork
    Text : >-
      From the Serpent's Pass within the valley forks the Lashend Road, the
      old highway that leads to Terraworth and the South March Province.
      The fork has been barricaded off, with dozens of hazard signs in all
      languages warning travelers to the dangers beyond. Unlike the Serpent's
      Pass, Lashend Road is not patrolled and has fallen victim to disuse and
      disrepair for centuries.


      Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a
      deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs,
      the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded,
      forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through
      pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their
      bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be
      necessary to avoid getting lost.
  -
    Subtitle : Lashend River
    Text : >-
      The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city.
      One of Baltatrax's first moves was to block and dam the river's source,
      knowing fully well that the city would collapse much more quickly as
      a result. Today, the river is but a small stream running through a dry,
      rocky riverbed.


      As the river is one of the only sources of clean water in the area, it
      tends to attract all manner of creatures, including the monsters that
      inhabit the area. The table below contains possible encounters for the
      party as they travel along the Lashend Road.

    Title : Towns of Terraworth
    Text : >-
      Like any major city, Terraworth was supported by a network of smaller
      towns and villages that supplied much of the food and raw materials
      needed by the city.


      These abandoned villages often hide minor relics of the First Age,
      which can fetch a decent price on the artifacts market. Small icons
      and statues of the Old Gods are the most common relic, but once in a blue
      moon a lucky hunter finds a wondrous item that still holds a bit of magic.

    Subtitle : Arkala Ruins
    Text : >-
      The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former
      farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the
      other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was
      quickly evacuated.


      Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest.
      Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their
      stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that
      the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins.


      As the party passes by Arkala, they can discover that a small group of
      amateur relic hunters are currently under attack in Arkala.
      

      If it is nighttime when the party passes by Arkala, a faint blue-green glow
      can be seen emanating from the town, interspersed with the occassional flash
      of energy. The faint sounds of clashing metal and energetic blasts can be heard
      with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.


      If it is daytime, a plume of black some can be seen rising into the air from
      the direction of Arkala, and the same Wisdom (Perception) check can be used
      to hear the sounds of combat.

    Subtitle : Ambush in Arkala
    Text : >-
      As Terraworth is the nearest and least dangerous major ruin of the First Age,
      it is a popular spot for novice treasure hunters to cut their teeth before
      heading out into the true dangers of the South March and Southguard Provinces.


      On this occasion, a pair of prospective adventurers is under attack in Arkala.
      Leighya Treadway and Arther Bramer, natives of Lindmont to the Southeast of
      Archersreve, are fending off a group of monsters consisting of:


          * 4 x Skeleton
          * 2 x Will-o'-Wisp
          * 1 x Poltergeist
          * 1 x Deathlock Wight


      The pair, as experienced former Republic soldiers, are holding out among the
      ruins of the town, but are running out of ammunition and won't hold out for
      much longer.


      If the party decides not to investigate Arkala, the encounter above is skipped,
      and the amateur hunters will be encountered later, but missing much of their
      prepared equipment and information, having been forced to leave it all behind
      when escaping Arkala.
  -
    Subtitle : Novice Adventurers
    Text : >-
      Leighya and Arther, fresh out of a conscription stint with the Army of
      the Republic, decided not to extend their warrants but rather to strike it
      out on their own. The two childhood friends have always been enamored with
      stories of daring explorers recovering ancient relics, and resolved to
      make those dreams come true.

      
      The pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers.
      They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth
      revealing a long lost treasure. Over the last 6 months, after their deployment
      with the Republic Army, the two have gathered as much information about
      Terraworth as possible, and posses highly detailed copies of maps from the
      Royal Archives in Blackpoint, belived to be the best available. They also carry
      all manner of adventuring gear, from hundreds of feet of rope to pickaxes to
      ichor (flameless) lamps. They also had a horse-drawn cart, which has long
      gone missing after the horse fled the ambush, taking the heavier equipment
      with it.


      Despite all their preparation and combat training, the pair were shocked at
      the strength and ferocity of the attack upon them. According to their
      research, a few skeletons or possibly a wisp or two should have been the
      worst thing they could encounter. The two are further convinced that something
      really must have awoken within the city ruins, and are more determined than ever
      to find out.


      If the pair is rescued from the ambush in Arkala, they will reluctantly
      offer their support and vast knowledge of the city to the party, in exchange
      for a mutually-beneficial combined expedition.


      If the pair is encountered later on, they will make the same offer, but
      will only have their memorized knowledge available, as the maps and notes
      were destroyed when they were forced to flee Arkala.


      Regardless of how they are met, the party will eventually notice that
      Arther has been extremely careful when handling a small satchel. A DC
      14 Wisdom (Perception) check can allow the party to hear a faint rasping
      sound coming from within the sack, which quickly prompts Arther to gently
      pat the bag unconciously.


      If pressed, Arther and Leighya will try to avoid the subject, claiming that
      the satchel simply holds some delicate supplies (ointments, antiseptics, etc.).
      If pressed further to reveal the contents, they will claim that the contents
      are very sensitive and expensive. Both statements are clearly false, and it
      is obvious that the pair don't want to reveal the true contents of the bag.


      If confronted or otherwise forced to open the satchel, Arther and Leighya
      will begrudgingly comply, warning the party to listen to him and not make
      any hasty decisions. Gingerly reaching into the pouch, Arthur repeatedly
      tells the party to stay calm as he reveals an ancient-looking skull, meticulously
      adorned with holy sigils and purity seals. As the skull is pulled out of the
      satchel, an ominous amber light begins to glow from within the eyesockets,
      and with a deep, rasping breath the skull is momentarily sheathed in green
      flames - a Flameskull!
  -
    Subtitle : Flameskull
    Text : >-
      As the flameskull awakens, it's clear that the charms and icons are somehow
      keeping it from flying into the psychotic frenzy that traditionally
      characterizes the creature. As the flames once again flicker on and off, 
      the skull rasps *"Help me..."*


      It's clear from the way that Arther and Leighya look and behave towards the
      flameskull that they have some emotional connection with it, possibly a
      combination of pity and sadness.


      If the party does not immediately attack and asks the pair to explain,
      Leighya will respond with their story.


      !!! quote
          We found him on our last mission. Our squad was sent to Terraworth to
          rescue some clueless merchants that were trying to find a shortcut to
          Rookwatch and got ambushed outside the ruins.


          He was just wandering aimlessly outside Arkala, cackling madly to itself
          every so often before crying out in anguish. We were just about to put
          an arrow through it when it suddenly turned and dashed towards us. I thought
          we were in for it when fire shot out from it's eyes, but instead of attacking
          us it hit the skeleton that had managed to sneak up behind us.


          I still remember the first words it said, *"Please, help me. I don't know
          what I am."* Then it just swung violently between fits of laughter and
          despair. We didn't know what to do, but we had a cleric, Sister Powall,
          she said he might be remembering his former life. He'd just saved mine,
          I felt we owed it to him to try to help.

          
      Leighya will continue explaining that the charms and sigils help calm it,
      almost like a sleeping trance. They've managed to talk to flameskull when
      it has a rare moment of lucidity, and have learned a little bit about the
      pitiful creature they now care for:


          * **Former Life.** The flameskull can remember very little about itself,
          only a momentary flash of a warrior in gleaming armor, perhaps a paladin.


          * **How it Died.** The last image the creature can remember is of a sickening
          green pulse of energy consuming all of its vision.


          * **Who Created It.** In undeath, the flameskull can remember things more
          vividly. It recalls being called to this life by a black-robed cultist,
          whose skin looked badly lesioned, as though he'd been severely burnt.


          * **Why it Behaves Strangely.** For months, the skull had obeyed its
          creator, all the while screaming internally and descending into madness
          over the atrocities it was forced to commit. He'd been shattered at some
          point during a fight with soldiers. He remembers a cleric, perhaps something
          he did had broken the cultist's control, at least partially.

    Subtitle : Terraworth Loop
    Text : >-
      At the third fork in the road on the way to Terraworth lies a loop that
      connects many of the surrounding town ruins with the city proper. The
      lower path leads to an abandoned Imperial outpost and the city of Terraworth,
      while the upper path leads to Krutoq's Tower and the supporting towns.
  -
    Subtitle : Cardend and Falkirk
    Text : >-
      Cardend and Falkirk are the two principal agricultural towns that once fed
      the massive populace of Terraworth. Like Arkala, the towns have been picked
      dry of any major First Age relics, leaving only the occasional rusted trinket.


      Occasionally, a band of monsters (from the table of Lashend River encounters)
      will take up temporary residence within the town ruins. It's clear that many
      prospective relic hunters have met their fate in these towns, as dessicated
      or skeletal remains can easily be found amongst the rubble. Basic adventuring
      supplies (rope, water bags, picks, torches, etc.) can be recovered from the
      remains.
  -
    Subtitle : Kirkwall Ruins
    Text : >-
      The mining town of Kirkwall stood to the far Northeast of Terraworth. The town
      was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was processed
      in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks of silver ore
      can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in hauling the heavy
      rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting.


      To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining complex,
      which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is rumored that
      the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to meet an
      untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most relic hunters
      avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation as well as a
      measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within.


      The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle.
      Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although
      there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within the
      debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma.

      
      Further investigation of the debris reveals that the equipment is a hodgepodge of
      pieces from both the First and Second Ages. Smithing touchmarks range from the
      forges of Terraworth to the manufactoria of Siddar City. A DC 18 Intelligence
      (History) check can reveal that the tooling marks on the Siddarese weapons are
      of a factory-forge that was only opened (with much fanfare) within the past decade.
      Additionally, a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check
      shows that the corpses are significantly older, with many showing clear signs of
      weathering and erosion to a degree that would indicate hundreds of years of exposure
      rather than the less-than-ten years some of the weapons would suggest.


      Despite the apparent contradiction, both timelines are correct. A battle did take
      place approximately 4 years prior, between the creatures living within
      the mines and a skeletal army of an Elumin (Death domain) cleric, Pleas Morgan.

    Title : Krutoq the Elven Lich
    Text : >-
      Elandorr Krutoq, former Councillor of Terraworth, was an elven wizard from around
      400 BGS. As Krutoq neared the end of his life, he became obsessed with the possibility
      of achieving immortality. Though very little is known about that time period,
      it is believed that Krutoq used his position and power to ensure his activities
      would not be halted. Indeed, Krutoq succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to
      convert the City's population into an undead army as payment to his fiendish patron.


      For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he
      had built ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious
      purposes. Krutoq was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery
      was never found. Given his high position within the city's government, Elandorr
      had successfully hidden his phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly
      that it would remain undisturbed until he could regenerate.


      Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection,
      leaving him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath. Should the
      phylactery be removed from the protection of the vault however, Krutoq would arise
      once again to a world without the Imperial might that once defeated him.
  -
    Subtitle : Pleas Morgan
    Text : >-
      Formerly a member of Blackpoint's clergy under the Primate, Pleas was drawn
      by the proscribed teachings of the dark side of Elumin, and was ejected from
      the priesthood for it. Pleas would have been executed for blasphemy, had he
      not been spirited away by like-minded cultists seeking his intimate knowledge
      of Blackpoint's ecclesiarchy.

      
      Morgan, acting on his twisted interpretation of Elumin's will, is attempting to
      locate Krutoq's phylactery within the ruins of Terraworth to revive the fallen
      lich. It is due to his efforts that rumors of an awakening in Terraworth have begun
      circulating the relic hunter community. Pleas, having been granted visions of a
      golden vault beneath Terraworth, is consumed with restoring the ancient lich.
  -
    Subtitle : Krutoq's Tower
    Text : >-
      To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially
      constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed
      by Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses.


      Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered
      remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the
      tower to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly
      after ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive
      Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower.


      At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and
      neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed
      in on themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the
      upper floors.


      The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks
      and an emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking
      Imperial garrison breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that
      it is being held together by the barest of threads.


      Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land
      seem to avoid the tower. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check will find a
      forgotten satchel in the barracks that looks too new to be from the First Age.
      Inside the satchel, some minor rations and supplies can be found, but the only
      thing of interest is a notebook filled with incomprehensible symbols. One page
      near the end has a map, but it is unlabeled and too low scale to figure out
      immediately. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check will allow the
      characters to realize that the map is of the former city of Terraworth.

    Title : City of Terraworth
    Text : >-
      Once a great Imperial Free City, Terraworth was one of the first major cities to
      fall to Baltatrax's hordes during the period known as the Great Sack. In the rising
      turmoil of the collapse of the Empire, Terraworth found itself increasingly isolated
      from the rest of the newly risen kingdoms and city states to the South, making it a
      tempting target for the Demon Lord's first major conquest.
  -
    Subtitle : Terraworth Outskirts
    Text : >-
      Like all great cities, Terraworth's growing population quickly outgrew the
      confines of the original walled city, leading to sprawling urban centers
      beyond the city walls. These outskirts, consisting primarily of lower class
      housing and industry, did not fare well under the onslaught of Baltatrax's attack,
      nor in the five centuries of abandonment that followed. In some sections, there is
      not a single standing building, with only foundations and partially buried rubble
      to indicate where a structure once stood.


      Many parts of the outskirts show weathered signs of fire damage, with the occasional
      mangled and rusted sword or speartip still embedded in an uncollapsed wall. The outskirts
      of the city are perilous for the inexperienced. Structures collapse with only the slightest
      disturbance, causing tons of rubble to fall on anyone unfortunate enough to be within. If a
      building collapses on someone, they can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to throw
      themselves under cover. On a failed check they take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and half
      as much on a successful check.

      
      The outskirts are occasionally patrolled by Pleas' minions. At least one of the creatures
      will attempt to flee and alert his master to the intruders. If the minion manages to evade
      the party, encounters within the city are reinforced.

    Text: >-
      The once mighty walls of Terraworth have been breached in several places, and the massive
      battering ram used by Baltatrax lies in ruins at the broken gate. The buildings directly
      within the city walls show much the same damage as the buildings outside, and it is clear
      that a conflagration destroyed much of what the Demon Lord's hordes did not.


      The outer districts were primarily slums and industrial areas. The fabled Forges of Terraworth,
      which once armed and supplied the legions of the Imperial Army, are located in the outer
      districts. The massive forges are known to hold hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
      unfinished weapons and blanks. Despite the centuries of pillaging by both the hordes and
      adventurous relic hunters, it is difficult not to trip over the vast quantity of unfinished
      materiel in and around the forges. Most of the pieces are mundane and otherwise uninteresting
      aside from their age, but can fetch a fair price to the right buyers.


      Most relic hunters who make it past the city walls venture no farther than the massive
      industrial foundries of the outer districts. The inner city is considered cursed, and recent
      stories of near-death escapes from terrifying creatures have done nothing to discourage this
      notion.
