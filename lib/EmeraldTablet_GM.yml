title : Emerald Tablets
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Emerald Tablets are a pentad of artifacts from before the First Age, which
    were themselves part of a terrible weapon that could level a city in the blink
    of an eye.


    The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs
    intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands
    of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly
    man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and
    craftsmen of today.


    It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to
    channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous
    system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of
    enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord.


    As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon,
    they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate
    and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival.


    The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell
    early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath
    tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.


    !!! tip "Random First Age Treasure"

        First Age materials for use with Azoth's enchantment circle, or sold at a high
        profit on the Siddar/Blackpoint markets. To this end, the party should be
        encouraged to thoroughly search and explore the area.


        Note that the random treasure tables on this sheet typically do not specify a
        quantity. For example, searching through Arkala may yield "Ruined Book or
        Manuscript", but it would be strange for the entire town to possess only a single
        damaged book.  You may roll multiple times on the treasure tables to generate
        additional treasures, and you may roll to determine the quantity of each treasure
        that is generated.


        Treasure comes in various "grades":  

          - Ruined / Rusted / Shattered
          - Good / Acceptable / Damaged
          - Excellent / Intact
          - Unique


        Treasure Quantities:

          - Ruined : 4d6
          - Good : 1d8
          - Excellent : 1d2 (or just 1)


        Unique treasure is usually a magic item or a named item, either directly
        granted by the table or rolled on one of the Magic Item Tables from the DMG.
        These can be things like "+" weapons, armor, and ammo, magic wands, magic
        scrolls, potions, and named magic items.

    Title : Reaching the Ophidian Valley
    Text : >-
      The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the
      far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after
      civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways
      that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With
      no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying
      hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere.


      Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies
      just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least
      dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and
      only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic
      hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be
      understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage,
      only half return alive.
  -
    Subtitle : Serpent's Pass
    Text : >-
      The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass,
      an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass
      connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls
      levied at Ravenhelm.


      The highway is well traveled, and both the Expedition and the Dusk Templars
      routinely patrol the area. Merchant caravans are routinely encountered,
      providing an opportunity for trade and resupply before heading out into
      the unclaimed wilderness.
  -
    Subtitle : Lashend Road Fork
    Text : >-
      From the Serpent's Pass within the valley forks the Lashend Road, the
      old highway that leads to Terraworth and the South March Province.
      The fork has been barricaded off, with dozens of hazard signs in all
      languages warning travelers to the dangers beyond. Unlike the Serpent's
      Pass, Lashend Road is not patrolled and has fallen victim to disuse and
      disrepair for centuries.


      Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a
      deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs,
      the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded,
      forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through
      pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their
      bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be
      necessary to avoid getting lost.
  -
    Subtitle : Lashend River
    Text : >-
      The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city.
      One of Baltatrax's first moves was to block and dam the river's source,
      knowing fully well that the city would collapse much more quickly as
      a result. Today, the river is but a small stream running through a dry,
      rocky riverbed.


      As the river is one of the only sources of clean water in the area, it
      tends to attract all manner of creatures, including the monsters that
      inhabit the area. The table below contains possible encounters for the
      party as they travel along the Lashend Road.

    Title : Towns of Terraworth
    Text : >-
      Like any major city, Terraworth was supported by a network of smaller
      towns and villages that supplied much of the food and raw materials
      needed by the city.


      These abandoned villages often hide minor relics of the First Age,
      which can fetch a decent price on the artifacts market. Small icons
      and statues of the Old Gods are the most common relic, but once in a blue
      moon a lucky hunter finds a wondrous item that still holds a bit of magic.

      The towns of Terraworth are relatively safe compared to the central city,
      but the players may still encounter dangerous creatures. In particular,
      an Adult Blue Dragon has made its lair to the far Southwest of Terraworth,
      and occasionally passes over the region while hunting. The dragon's lair is
      covered in a separate, dedicated section.

      
      One of these encounters is a patrol by [Pleas Morgan's]
      (EmeraldTablet_GM.md#pleas-morgan) minions. These minions will behave
      differently than the other local creatures, as they will attempt to send
      a runner into the city proper to alert their master to the intruders. If a
      runner makes it to the city, the players can expect heavier patrols as
      outlined in the [Pleas' Patrols)(EmeraldTablet_GM.md#pleas-patrols] section.

    Subtitle : Arkala Ruins
    Text : >-
      The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former
      farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the
      other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was
      quickly evacuated.


      Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest.
      Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their
      stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that
      the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins.


      As the party passes by Arkala, they can discover that a small group of
      amateur relic hunters are currently under attack in Arkala.
      

      If it is nighttime when the party passes by Arkala, a faint blue-green glow
      can be seen emanating from the town, interspersed with the occassional flash
      of energy. The faint sounds of clashing metal and energetic blasts can be heard
      with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.


      If it is daytime, a plume of black some can be seen rising into the air from
      the direction of Arkala, and the same Wisdom (Perception) check can be used
      to hear the sounds of combat.
  -
    Subtitle : Ambush in Arkala
    Text : >-
      As Terraworth is the nearest and least dangerous major ruin of the First Age,
      it is a popular spot for novice treasure hunters to cut their teeth before
      heading out into the true dangers of the South March and Southguard Provinces.


      On this occasion, a pair of prospective adventurers is under attack in Arkala.
      Leighya Treadway and Arther Bramer, natives of Lindmont to the Southeast of
      Archersreve, are fending off a group of monsters consisting of:


          * 4 x Skeleton
          * 2 x Will-o'-Wisp
          * 1 x Poltergeist
          * 1 x Deathlock Wight


      The pair, as experienced former Republic soldiers, are holding out among the
      ruins of the town, but are running out of ammunition and won't hold out for
      much longer.


      If the party decides not to investigate Arkala, the encounter above is skipped,
      and the amateur hunters will be encountered later, but missing much of their
      prepared equipment and information, having been forced to leave it all behind
      when escaping Arkala.
  -
    Subtitle : Novice Adventurers
    Text : >-
      Leighya and Arther, fresh out of a conscription stint with the Army of
      the Republic, decided not to extend their warrants but rather to strike it
      out on their own. The two childhood friends have always been enamored with
      stories of daring explorers recovering ancient relics, and resolved to
      make those dreams come true.

      
      The pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers.
      They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth
      revealing a long lost treasure. Over the last 6 months, after their deployment
      with the Republic Army, the two have gathered as much information about
      Terraworth as possible, and posses highly detailed copies of maps from the
      Royal Archives in Blackpoint, belived to be the best available. They also carry
      all manner of adventuring gear, from hundreds of feet of rope to pickaxes to
      ichor (flameless) lamps. They also had a horse-drawn cart, which has long
      gone missing after the horse fled the ambush, taking the heavier equipment
      with it.


      Despite all their preparation and combat training, the pair were shocked at
      the strength and ferocity of the attack upon them. According to their
      research, a few skeletons or possibly a wisp or two should have been the
      worst thing they could encounter. The two are further convinced that something
      really must have awoken within the city ruins, and are more determined than ever
      to find out.


      If the pair is rescued from the ambush in Arkala, they will reluctantly
      offer their support and vast knowledge of the city to the party, in exchange
      for a mutually-beneficial combined expedition.


      If the pair is encountered later on, they will make the same offer, but
      will only have their memorized knowledge available, as the maps and notes
      were destroyed when they were forced to flee Arkala. Some details will be
      missing, but between the pair they can remember every major step and landmark
      along their planned route.


      Regardless of how they are met, the pair will guide the party deep into the
      ruins of Terraworth, into what used to be the governmental district. Based
      on the information they've collected in the past several months indicates
      that there is a previously undiscovered vault beneath the Imperial Archives,
      which could hold untold riches.


      After a few hours together, the party will eventually notice that
      Leighya has been extremely careful when handling a small satchel. A DC
      14 Wisdom (Perception) check can allow the party to hear a faint rasping
      sound coming from within the sack, which quickly prompts Arther to gently
      pat the bag unconciously.


      If pressed, Arther and Leighya will try to avoid the subject, claiming that
      the satchel simply holds some delicate supplies (ointments, antiseptics, etc.).
      If pressed further to reveal the contents, they will claim that the contents
      are very sensitive and expensive. Both statements are clearly false, and it
      is obvious that the pair don't want to reveal the true contents of the bag.


      If confronted or otherwise forced to open the satchel, Arther and Leighya
      will begrudgingly comply, warning the party to listen to him and not make
      any hasty decisions. Gingerly reaching into the pouch, Arthur repeatedly
      tells the party to stay calm as he reveals an ancient-looking skull, meticulously
      adorned with holy sigils and purity seals. As the skull is pulled out of the
      satchel, an ominous amber light begins to glow from within the eyesockets,
      and with a deep, rasping breath the skull is momentarily sheathed in green
      flames - a Flameskull!
  -
    Subtitle : Flameskull
    Text : >-
      As the flameskull awakens, it's clear that the charms and icons are somehow
      keeping it from flying into the psychotic frenzy that traditionally
      characterizes the creature. As the flames once again flicker on and off, 
      the skull rasps *"Help me..."*


      It's clear from the way that Arther and Leighya look and behave towards the
      flameskull that they have some emotional connection with it, possibly a
      combination of pity and sadness.


      If the party does not immediately attack and asks the pair to explain,
      Leighya will respond with their story.


      !!! quote
          We found him on our last mission. Our squad was sent to Terraworth to
          rescue some clueless merchants that were trying to find a shortcut to
          Rookwatch and got ambushed outside the ruins.


          He was just wandering aimlessly outside Arkala, cackling madly to itself
          every so often before crying out in anguish. We were just about to put
          an arrow through it when it suddenly turned and dashed towards us. I thought
          we were in for it when fire shot out from it's eyes, but instead of attacking
          us it hit the skeleton that had managed to sneak up behind us.


          I still remember the first words it said, *"Please, help me. I don't know
          what I am."* Then it just swung violently between fits of laughter and
          despair. We didn't know what to do, but we had a cleric, Sister Powall,
          she said he might be remembering his former life. He'd just saved mine,
          I felt we owed it to him to try to help.

          
      Leighya will continue explaining that the charms and sigils help calm it,
      almost like a sleeping trance. They've managed to talk to flameskull when
      it has a rare moment of lucidity, and have learned a little bit about the
      pitiful creature they now care for:


      !!! info "The Flameskull"
          * **Former Life.** The flameskull can remember very little about itself,
          only a momentary flash of a warrior in gleaming armor, perhaps a paladin.


          * **How it Died.** The last image the creature can remember is of a sickening
          green pulse of energy consuming all of its vision.


          * **Who Created It.** In undeath, the flameskull can remember things more
          vividly. It recalls being called to this life by a black-robed cultist,
          whose skin looked badly lesioned, as though he'd been severely burnt.


          * **Why it Behaves Strangely.** For months, the skull had obeyed its
          creator, all the while screaming internally and descending into madness
          over the atrocities it was forced to commit. He'd been shattered at some
          point during a fight with soldiers. He remembers a cleric, perhaps something
          he did had broken the cultist's control, at least partially.

    Subtitle : Terraworth Loop
    Text : >-
      At the third fork in the road on the way to Terraworth lies a loop that
      connects many of the surrounding town ruins with the city proper. The
      lower path leads to an abandoned Imperial outpost and the city of Terraworth,
      while the upper path leads to Krutoq's Tower and the supporting towns.
  -
    Subtitle : Cardend and Falkirk
    Text : >-
      Cardend and Falkirk are the two principal agricultural towns that once fed
      the massive populace of Terraworth. Like Arkala, the towns have been picked
      dry of any major First Age relics, leaving only the occasional rusted trinket.


      Occasionally, a band of monsters (from the table of Lashend River encounters)
      will take up temporary residence within the town ruins. It's clear that many
      prospective relic hunters have met their fate in these towns, as dessicated
      or skeletal remains can easily be found amongst the rubble. Basic adventuring
      supplies (rope, water bags, picks, torches, etc.) can be recovered from the
      remains.
  -
    Subtitle : Kirkwall Ruins
    Text : >-
      The mining town of Kirkwall stood to the far Northeast of Terraworth. The town
      was famous in the First Age for the high quality silver ore, which was processed
      in the dwarven forges of Terraworth and Dirbuhr. Even today, chunks of silver ore
      can be easily found, as most relic hunters have no interest in hauling the heavy
      rock all the way to Blackpoint or Ravenhelm for smelting.


      To either side of the town lay the entrances to a massive silver mining complex,
      which has become the home of many a monster and abomination. It is rumored that
      the town's population once sought refuge within the mines, only to meet an
      untimely death when Baltatrax's hordes poured into the shafts. Most relic hunters
      avoid the mines, both out of a healthy dose of self preservation as well as a
      measure of respect towards the massacre that occurred within.


      The entrances to the mines are littered with the remains of a massive battle.
      Broken pieces of armor and weapons are strewn throughout the area, although
      there are comparatively few skeletal remains of creatures to be found within the
      debris, and those that are present appear to have suffered massive trauma.

      
      Further investigation of the debris reveals that the equipment is a hodgepodge of
      pieces from both the First and Second Ages. Smithing touchmarks range from the
      forges of Terraworth to the manufactoria of Siddar City. A DC 18 Intelligence
      (History) check can reveal that the tooling marks on the Siddarese weapons are
      of a factory-forge that was only opened (with much fanfare) within the past decade.
      Additionally, a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check or a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check
      shows that the corpses are significantly older, with many showing clear signs of
      weathering and erosion to a degree that would indicate hundreds of years of exposure
      rather than the less-than-ten years some of the weapons would suggest.


      Despite the apparent contradiction, both timelines are correct. A battle did take
      place approximately 4 years prior, between the creatures living within
      the mines and a skeletal army of an Elumin (Death domain) cleric, Pleas Morgan.

    Title : Krutoq the Elven Lich
    Text : >-
      Elandorr Krutoq, former Councillor of Terraworth, was an elven wizard from around
      400 BGS. As Krutoq neared the end of his life, he became obsessed with the possibility
      of achieving immortality. Though very little is known about that time period,
      it is believed that Krutoq used his position and power to ensure his activities
      would not be halted. Indeed, Krutoq succeeded in becoming a Lich, and attempted to
      convert the City's population into an undead army as payment to his fiendish patron.


      For nearly 5 years, Krutoq amassed an army from his fortified tower, which he
      had built ostensibly for the Imperial Army before seizing it for his own nefarious
      purposes. Krutoq was eventually defeated by the city's forces, but his phylactery
      was never found. Given his high position within the city's government, Elandorr
      had successfully hidden his phylactery within the city's vaults, guessing correctly
      that it would remain undisturbed until he could regenerate.


      Unfortunately for Krutoq, the vault's ancient wards prevented his resurrection,
      leaving him trapped on the purgatory between life and undeath. Should the
      phylactery be removed from the protection of the vault however, Krutoq would arise
      once again to a world without the Imperial might that once defeated him.

    Subtitle : Pleas Morgan
    Text : >-
      Formerly a member of Blackpoint's clergy under the Primate, Pleas was drawn
      by the proscribed teachings of the dark side of Elumin, and was ejected from
      the priesthood for it. Pleas would have been executed for blasphemy, had he
      not been spirited away by like-minded cultists seeking his intimate knowledge
      of Blackpoint's ecclesiarchy.

      
      Morgan, acting on his twisted interpretation of Elumin's will, is attempting to
      locate Krutoq's phylactery within the ruins of Terraworth to revive the fallen
      lich. It is due to his efforts that rumors of an awakening in Terraworth have begun
      circulating the relic hunter community. Pleas, having been granted visions of a
      golden vault beneath Terraworth, is consumed with restoring the ancient lich.

    Subtitle : Krutoq's Tower
    Text : >-
      To the far Northwest of Terraworth lies a ruined fortified tower. Officially
      constructed as a military fortification for the Empire, the tower was constructed by
      Krutoq prior to his ascencion to lichdom for his own evil uses.


      Although Krutoq was defeated some 400 years prior to the Great Sack, the battered
      remains of his tower still stand. The inhabitants of Terraworth believed the tower
      to be cursed, as three consecutive Councillors met unfortunate fates shortly after
      ordering the tower's destruction. Content to leave well enough alone, successive
      Councillors abandoned all plans to take down the tower.


      At the present time, the tower is partially collapsed from centuries of wear and
      neglect. Only the bottom two levels are accessible, as the rest have collapsed in on
      themselves. Outside, the ground is barren and littered with debris of the upper
      floors.


      The first level is composed of a small fort, complete with a small barracks and an
      emptied armory. There are several large holes where the attacking Imperial garrison
      breached the fort, and the structure gives the impression that it is being held
      together by the barest of threads.


      Aside from the debris, the tower is empty. Even the creatures that roam the land
      seem to avoid the tower. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check will find a
      forgotten satchel in the barracks that looks too new to be from the First Age.
      Inside the satchel, some minor rations and supplies can be found, but the only thing
      of interest is a notebook filled with incomprehensible symbols. A DC 17 Wisdom
      (Insight) check is needed to decipher some of the journal. One page near the end has
      a map, but it is unlabeled and too low scale to figure out immediately. A successful
      DC 13 Intelligence (History) check will allow the characters to realize that the map
      is of the former city of Terraworth.

          *569Y 7M 18KAL* - I saw the light of the golden candles that shone down upon him
          who dwells beneath the brass gates, an angel cast out of the tribe of the martyr
          and sealed with hellfire. I know what I must do. My master wills it.

          The blasphemers who dared to cast me out shall taste the righteous hellfire of
          my master's wrath, delivered upon the swordpoint of the cast away angel.

          *569Y 10M 8IDE* - I have found the brass gates, but the heretics' seals
          frustrate me still. My master grows impatient. I must not disappoint him.

          *570Y 1M 6NON* - A vision came to me. I must walk in the angel's footsteps
          if I am to free him. I have studied the *true* holy texts of Elumin, and with
          the enchained angel's tomes I shall ascend to Elumin's side.

          *570Y 3M 12KAL* - The first seal is broken. My master is pleased. The angel
          Elandorr shall once again spread my master's light throughout Tritan, and I
          shall have my revenge upon the apostates. Praise Elumin.

          Tomorrow, I shall return to the angel's keep and continue my search for the
          holy basin upon which the angel shall restore his heavenly host.
          
          *570Y 3M 3KAL* I have failed in my search for the angel's basin. I can only
          trust in Elumin's grace that the angel shall prevail despite my failure. I
          will return to the brass gates on the morrow.

    Title : City of Terraworth
    Text : >-
      Once a great Imperial Free City, Terraworth was one of the first major cities to
      fall to Baltatrax's hordes during the period known as the Great Sack. In the rising
      turmoil of the collapse of the Empire, Terraworth found itself increasingly isolated
      from the rest of the newly risen kingdoms and city states to the South, making it a
      tempting target for the Demon Lord's first major conquest.
  -
    Subtitle : Terraworth Outskirts
    Text : >-
      Like all great cities, Terraworth's growing population quickly outgrew the
      confines of the original walled city, leading to sprawling urban centers
      beyond the city walls. These outskirts, consisting primarily of lower class
      housing and industry, did not fare well under the onslaught of Baltatrax's attack,
      nor in the five centuries of abandonment that followed. In some sections, there is
      not a single standing building, with only foundations and partially buried rubble
      to indicate where a structure once stood.


      Many parts of the outskirts show weathered signs of fire damage, with the occasional
      mangled and rusted sword or speartip still embedded in an uncollapsed wall. The
      outskirts of the city are perilous for the inexperienced. Structures collapse with
      only the slightest disturbance, causing tons of rubble to fall on anyone unfortunate
      enough to be within. If a building collapses on someone, they can make a DC 15
      Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to throw themselves under cover. On a failed check they
      take 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on a successful check.

      
      One of the more recognizable sites on the city outskirts are the old Imperial Army
      Training Grounds. Although no structures remain, the large parade grounds are a dead
      giveaway.


      Based on their experience with the Expedition, Leighya will suggest that
      the training grounds may hold hidden underground caches of weapons and supplies.
      Indeed, a handful of caches lie exposed where treasure hunters have stumbled
      upon one. If Leighya has the Royal Archive maps, a pair of caches can be found
      easily. Without the maps, a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed
      to find each of two caches.


      Each cache contains:


        - One dozen mundane melee and ranged weapons
        - One dozen armor pieces of mixed type
        - Roll once on the
          [Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5-10 Table in the DMG][5_10_Hoard_TreasureTable]


      The outskirts are occasionally patrolled by Pleas' minions. At least one of the
      creatures will attempt to flee and alert his master to the intruders. If the minion
      manages to evade the party, encounters within the city are reinforced.

    Subtitle: Outer City Districts
    Text: >-
      The once mighty walls of Terraworth have been breached in several places, and the
      massive battering ram used by Baltatrax lies in ruins at the broken gate. The
      buildings directly within the city walls show much the same damage as the buildings
      outside, and it is clear that a conflagration destroyed much of what the Demon Lord's
      hordes did not.


      The outer districts were primarily slums and industrial areas. The fabled Forges of
      Terraworth, which once armed and supplied the legions of the Imperial Army, are
      located in the outer districts. 


      Most relic hunters who make it past the city walls venture no farther than the massive
      industrial foundries of the outer districts. The inner city is considered cursed, and
      recent stories of near-death escapes from terrifying creatures have done nothing to
      discourage this notion.

      
      The massive forges are known to hold hundreds of
      thousands, if not millions, of unfinished weapons and blanks. Despite the centuries
      of pillaging by both the hordes and adventurous relic hunters, it is difficult not
      to trip over the vast quantity of unfinished materiel in and around the forges. Most
      of the pieces are mundane and otherwise uninteresting aside from their age, but can
      fetch a fair price to the right buyers.


      The forges are comparatively safe, but if the party spends too long gathering blanks
      and scrap, there is a good chance that a random patrol will stumble upon them. While
      the forges are no longer lit, the area still contains several environmental hazards.
      Large acid vats, once used to clean blanks and stamps, have not lost much potency
      over the years. Flammeble materials are ubiquitous, and a stray spark or flame can
      result in lethal detonations.

      Beyond the forges lies the ruins of the tenement districts and commercial zones.
      The districts are largely burnt down, and there's nothing of particular interest
      within. A few of the remaining buildings contain the lairs of dangerous creatures,
      and are best avoided. Arther and Leighya will strongly suggest that the party avoid
      the rest of the Outer Districts.

    Subtitle: Brass Gates of Terraworth
    Text: >-
      The Imperial District (and the Imperial Archive) is separated from the surrounding
      ruins by an internal rampart. The main entryway into the district was through a set
      of large, decorative brass gates, which are little more than twisted wrecks amidst
      the rubble. Still, the gates remain within the popular mindset as the defining line
      between the comparatively safe outer city and the terrors that lie within the inner
      city.

      
      The Imperial District holds the ruins of hundreds of massive structures, ranging
      from the burnt rubble of the former University of the Arcane Sciences to the collapsed
      domes of the Hippodrome. Many of these buildings are rumored to hold powerful
      ancient artifacts. Unfortunately for would be treasure hunters, the inner districts
      host many dangerous creatures and abominations.
  -
    Subtitle: University of Arcane Sciences
    Text: >-
      The University was once a leading artificer institution for the Empire. The magi of
      the University were responsible for many of the metallurgic and enchantment advances
      that propelled Terraworth into becoming the Armory of the Empire.


      The University consisted of multiple large auditoriums and alchemical laboratories.
      Small scale replicas of the massive Terraworth Forges served as hands-on workshops
      for many of the Empire's artificers.


      Today, the university lies to the southwest of the city center, a burnt out skeleton
      of it's former self. The lecture halls have collapsed into small, dusty calderas.
      Nearly all of the forges exploded shortly after the city was ransacked due to the
      lack of maintenance, starting the fires that consumed the rest of the University
      and the surrounding dormitories.


      The ruins are sure to contain artifacts buried under tons of rubble. A DC 16
      Strength check and at least two hours of hard labor are needed to clear a
      region large enough to search. A subsequent DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)

    Subtitle: Terraworth Hippodrome
    Text: >-
      To the East of the central districts lies the collapsed domes of the Terraworth
      Hippodrome. The complex was once the largest enterntainment venue within the city,
      capable of hosting over 60,000 spectators in the main collosseum alone. Smaller
      arenas and racetracks surround the massive central structure. During the height of
      the Empire, the Terraworth Hippodrome hosted every kind of spectator event, from
      horse and chariot races to gladitorial contests and even simulated naval battles.


      In the centuries since the sack, the structural integrity of most of the domes has
      been compromised. The central dome has collapsed completely. burying the area in
      thousands of tons of concrete rubble. A few of the smaller domes, especially the
      older, pre-Imperial amphitheatre, still stand to this day, but show signs of
      cracking and stress.


      It is likely that the domes contain large amounts of First Age artifacts and
      relics, buried beneath the collapsed domes. A DC 17 Strength check is needed in
      order to clear off the large pieces of debris from an area in order to
      search. A subsequent successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the
      party to find interesting objects within the rubble.

      The Hippodrome is a dangerous location within Terraworth, primarily due to the
      instability of the ruins. Most creatures avoid the domes, but if the party has
      been previously spotted by a patrol, then one of Pleas' patrols may stumble upon
      them.


      Much like an avalanche, any disturbance of the ruins can spell disaster for
      anyone caught in the region. If the party causes a small disturbance such as
      loud sounds, strong ground vibrations, explosions, or any result of
      carelessness or combat, roll 1d20. On a result of 19 - 20, the structure
      partially collapses. Everyone in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity Saving
      Throw to avoid being crushed by falling rubble. On a failed save, the creature
      takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save as they
      dodge the largest pieces.


      If a creature inside the dome triggers a partial collapse for any reason, roll
      1d10. If the rolled number is less than the number of partial collapses that have
      occurred, the building fully collapses. Every creature within the structure takes
      8d10 bludgeoning damage as the roof collapses.

      The bazaar's wares have long since been looted or destroyed by the invading hordes.
      Occasionally however, there is an item of value that survived buried beneath the
      wreckage. A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to spot the item within the
      rubble.

      The Bazaar is relatively safe, subject only to the occasional patrol by Pleas' minions.

    Title: Imperial Forum

      The Terraworth Forum was the seat of administration for government of the city
      and the surrounding territories. Major ruins within the Forum include the City
      Council Chamber, the Basilica of Terraworth, the Imperial Gardens, and the
      Imperial Palace.

    Subtitle: City Council Chamber
    Text: >-
      The official seat of the Councillors of Terraworth, the Council Chamber was the
      seat of power for the Terraworth Imperial Province. Located close to the center
      of the city, to the west of the Basilica, the Council Chamber is surrounded by
      the ruins of the various Forum buildings that housed the city's administration.


      As a Free City, Terraworth enjoyed a great deal of autonomy within the
      Empire. While the Councillor was officially the Emperor's direct
      representative, in reality the Councillor was practically a monarch, ruling
      over the Ophidian Valley much like in the Pre-Imperial Age. Given Terraworth's
      massive value as a forge city, few in the Imperial Government at the World's
      Gate dared to try to curtail Terraworth's prerogatives.


      The Council Chamber, while not as lavish as the Imperial Palace, was modeled on
      classical temple architecture, with the central structure flanked by dozens of
      columns supporting an intricately carved elevation. The inside of the structure
      was divided into several smaller working chambers surrouding a large audience
      hall. Since the Great Sack, the chamber roof has partially collapsed, along with
      several columns, exposing the inner chambers to the elements.


      The Council Chamber was cursed by Baltatrax after his conquest of the
      city. Upon entering the structure, a non-evil aligned creature must make a DC
      18 Charisma Saving Throw, or gain a madness effect. Roll once on the [Long-Term
      Madness][LongTermMadness] table and apply the effect for 1d10 x 10 hours, or
      until cured through *lesser restoration* or *remove curse*.

      The golden spires of the Basilica of Terraworth were once as famous as the
      Brass Gates of the Imperial District. Towering above the rest of the skyline,
      the spires were dedicated to specific gods of the Old Pantheon.


      Unfortunately for the party, Baltatrax had the Basilica utterly wiped off the
      face of Tritan, leaving only a massive scar at the city's center. The only
      visible remnant of the building is the rough outline of the Basilica floorplan.


      There is a hidden entrance to the Basilica Catacombs that has remained
      undisturbed since before the Great Sack. A DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation)
      check is needed to find the entrance. A subsequent DC 17 Strength check can
      force open the sealed entrance, or a DC 16 Intelligence (Religion or History)
      to deduce the correct unlocking sequence for the Old Pantheon symbols found
      carved into the stone.

      The Basilica Catacombs hold the bodies of hundreds of Terraworth's holy
      figures, including the last Kings and Councillors of their respective eras.
      The catacombs are relatively small compared to the size of the city, as very
      few earned the honor of being buried within the hallowed ground.


      The catacombs connect via a secret tunnel to the Vault beneath the Imperial
      Palace. The passage is hidden behind a false burial shelf bearing the inscription
      'Elandorr, City Councillor'. The sarcophagus within the shelf is empty and

      The gardens today are the primary roaming grounds of many dangerous creatures,
      which often break out into fights for dominance or control of territory. The

      The Imperial Palace was originally the home of the Terraworth royal family in
      the time before the Empire. The Palace itself is a majestic U-shaped *corps de
      logic*, flanked on either side by symmetrical secondary wings. When the Empire
      formally annexed Terraworth, the Palace was converted into the seat of the
      Imperial Administration for the region. Most of the original royal apartments
      have been converted into offices and suites to hold the growing
      bureaucracy. Although the City Councillor traditionally held office within the
      Council Chamber, a small section of the Northern wing served as the private
      residence for the incumbent.


      Of particular interest to the Party, the cellars beneath the Palace were
      converted into the Terraworth Imperial Archives, the location of many of
      Terraworth's most valuable treasures, and the location of the Hidden Vault
      holding Krutoq's phylactery.
