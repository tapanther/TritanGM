title : The Emerald Tablets
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Emerald Tablets are a pentad of artifacts from before the First Age, which
    were themselves part of a terrible weapon that could level a city in the blink
    of an eye.


    The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs
    intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands
    of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly
    man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and
    craftsmen of today.


    It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to
    channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous
    system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of
    enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord.


    As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon,
    they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate
    and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival.


    The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell
    early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath
    tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.

    Title : Reaching Terraworth
    Text : >-
      The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the
      far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after
      civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways
      that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With
      no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying
      hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere.


      Terraworth is the easiest to reach of the great First Age ruins, as it lies
      just outside the borders of Second Age civilization. It is also the least
      dangerous, as most of the monsters and hordes have long since moved on, and
      only a handful of beasts call the ruins home. As a result, many aspiring relic
      hunters cut their teeth at Terraworth. Yet the danger should not be
      understated; of those foolhardy souls that attempt to scavenge the wreckage,
      only half return alive.

    Subtitle : Serpent's Pass
    Text : >-
      The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass,
      an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass
      connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls
      levied at Ravenhelm.


      The highway is well traveled, and both the Expedition and the Dusk Templars
      routinely patrol the area. Merchant caravans are routinely encountered,
      providing an opportunity for trade and resupply before heading out into
      the unclaimed wilderness.

    Subtitle : Lashend Road Fork
    Text : >-
      From the Serpent's Pass within the valley forks the Lashend Road, the
      old highway that leads to Terraworth and the South March Province.
      The fork has been barricaded off, with dozens of hazard signs in all
      languages warning travelers to the dangers beyond. Unlike the Serpent's
      Pass, Lashend Road is not patrolled and has fallen victim to disuse and
      disrepair for centuries.


      Bypassing the barricades is trivial, as they are primarily meant as a
      deterrent rather than a true barrier. Immediately beynod the signs,
      the road is uneven and overgrown with vegetation. Travel is impeded,
      forcing the party to proceed at half-rate, as though travelling through
      pure wilderness. The road mainly allows the party to maintain their
      bearings with ease, avoiding the survival checks that would otherwise be
      necessary to avoid getting lost.

    Subtitle : Lashend River
    Text : >-
      The road follows the Lashend River, formerly the lifeblood of the city.
      One of Baltatrax's first moves was to block and dam the river's source,
      knowing fully well that the city would collapse much more quickly as
      a result. Today, the river is but a small stream running through a dry,
      rocky riverbed.


      As the river is one of the only sources of clean water in the area, it
      tends to attract all manner of creatures, including the monsters that
      inhabit the area. The table below contains possible encounters for the
      party as they travel along the Lashend Road.

    Title : Towns of Terraworth
    Text : >-
      Like any major city, Terraworth was supported by a network of smaller
      towns and villages that supplied much of the food and raw materials
      needed by the city.


      These abandoned villages often hide minor relics of the First Age,
      which can fetch a decent price on the artifacts market. Small icons
      and statues of the Old Gods are the most common relic, but once in a blue
      moon a lucky hunter finds a wondrous item that still holds a bit of magic.

    Subtitle : Arkala Ruins
    Text : >-
      The first town ruins along the Lashend River is the town of Arkala. A former
      farming town, Arkala was largely spared the devastation wrought to many of the
      other villages. As Baltatrax's forces descended from the East, the town was
      quickly evacuated.


      Arkala is completely deserted, and nearly devoid of anything of interest.
      Relic hunters have stripped the place bare. The telltale signs of their
      stay (burnt out coals, bundled hay mats, forgotten tools, etc.) show that
      the town is primarily used by hunters on their way to the ruins.


      As the party passes near Arkala, they can perform a DC 13 Wisdom
      (Perception) check to spot a wispy trail of smoke rising from the town.
      A duo of novice treasure hunters have set up a campsite at Arkala. The
      pair are on their first expedition, and largely unaware of the dangers.
      They have heard rumours that something has awoken within Terraworth
      revealing a long lost treasure, and the pair have a plan.


      Unfortunately, the party are not the only ones to notice the smoke, and the
      deserted village is suddenly
