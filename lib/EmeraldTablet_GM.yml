title : The Emerald Tablets
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Emerald Tablets are a pentad of artifacts from before the First Age, which
    were themselves part of a terrible weapon that could level a city in the blink
    of an eye.


    The Emerald Tablets, as the name suggests, are bright green gemstone slabs
    intricately inscribed with gold and silver runes, and littered with thousands
    of small stones, jewels, and charms of unknown purpose. The tablets are clearly
    man-made, though their manufacture is beyond even the most skilled jewelers and
    craftsmen of today.


    It was believed by Hermes Trismegistus that the delicate runes were meant to
    channel and control the arcane energy of the weapon, similar to a nervous
    system. Indeed, the tablets connect to the inner casing pustules by a tangle of
    enameled wires, much like nerves tendril out from a spinal cord.


    As the tablets are the most fragile and susceptible component of the weapon,
    they were hidden within the forge city of Terraworth, where the warm, dry climate
    and lack of natural disasters would provide the greatest likelihood of survival.


    The tablets' precise location has been lost to history. When Terraworth fell
    early during the Great Sack, the vaults that held the tablets were buried beneath
    tons of rubble, sealed off from the rest of the world.

    Title : Reaching Terraworth
    Text : >-
      The ruins of Terraworth lie at the crook of the Ophidian Mountains, to the
      far Northwest of the South March Province. The area is largely deserted; after
      civilization was driven out by Baltatrax's hordes, the canals and waterways
      that brought life to the otherwise desolate valley fell into disrepair. With
      no water, the majority of the flora and fauna died off, forcing the occupying
      hordes to seek greener pastures elsewhere.

      The only maintained roadway into the Ophidian Valley is the Serpent's Pass,
      an ancient traderoute far to the west of the city ruins. The Serpent's Pass
      connects Blackpoint with Cantfall, allowing traders to bypass the heavy tolls
      levied at Ravenhelm.
