title : Murder on the Stonhyr Express
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Stonhyr Express is the premier rail service between Siddar City
    and Blackpoint at the tail end of the 8th Century AGS. The line is
    operated by the International Company of Sleeping Cars, I.C.S.C., by
    license of the Trans-Siddar Railroad, the Republic's semi-public rail
    corporation.


    This module focuses on a particularly unfortunate trip on the Sixth Day
    before the Ides of the Twelfth Moon of the Year 795 AGS (6IDE 3M 795Y).
    The Express, delayed due to a higher-precedence military rail convoy, is
    caught in a terrible blizzard West of Featherfurth, and derails on a
    snowbank. The following morning, two murders are discovered in the First
    Class sleeping car. What looks like an argument over gambling debts gone
    bad is quickly revealed as a double homicide, and with the blizzard raging,
    the killer must still be onboard.

      *Bio*


      A former detective for the Siddar City Gendarmerie, Cochran was
      an early investor in the burgeoning railways of the Republic,
      making him fantastically wealthy. After his forced retirement,
      Cochran founded the International Company of Sleeping Cars with
      a group of investors, spurred by the dream of luxurious rail travel.


      *Secret*


      The I.C.S.C. Board has threatened to remove Cochran from the
      directorship if the company stock misses yet another earnings
      forecast. The news of an unsolved pair of murders on the train
      would be disastrous for public perception in the company.


      *Alibi*


      Cochran's dominant hand has no strength due to an accident during
      his days at the Gendarmerie. Additionally, he was with Mat Stoker
      and the engineers in the locomotive at the time of the crimes.


      *Notable*


      Silver Gray suit bearing the company lapel pin. Right hand doesn't
      clench. Right Handed, but learned to use Left.

      *Bio*


      A veteran of the recent Western Conflicts, Col. Labey holds an automatic distrust
      bordering on outright xenophobia of foreigners. Dohlarans are only barely a step
      above the Western savages in his book. He was Katherine Rand's former superior
      officer during her youth in the military.


      *Secret*


      He is deeply in love with Ms. Rand, and has been secretly seeing her despite the
      risks to both (he was never implicated in the scandal that kicked her out of the
      Army, but could stand court martial for hiding it ever since).
      
      

      *Alibi*


      He was with Lette all throughout the night of the crime, beyond Pinkerton's suite.
      

      *Notable*

      *Bio*


      A strict governess, Katherine has tried to escape a sordid past as a dishonorably
      discharged draftee. She's relied on a new name and an adopted identity to ensure
      she can find jobs as a governess. She is trying to move westward where it is less
      likely she will be recognized and revealed.


      *Secret*


      She was dishonorably discharged from the Army for getting romantically involved
      with a superior officer (Col. Labey), and failing to disclose his identity when
      investigated.
      

      *Alibi*


      She was beyond Pinkerton's suite at the time of the murders.

      Luther Lette was a promising law student, but his excessive love for inebriating
      drinks caused the University to expell him. He has taken odd secretarial jobs
      ever since to make ends meet.


      *Secret*


      Lette has been embezzling from Forbes for the past year, both out of greed and
      out of hatred, as he knows Forbes killed George Pabst on purpose.

      The son of a decorated Gendarme Detective, Merl decided at an early age
      not to follow directly in his father's gootsteps, and instead launched
      an early form of the private detective agency. He is well known among
      the Gendarme as an expert sleuth, but has managed to keep his name relatively
      well hidden from the general consciousness.


      *Secret*

      
      Pinkerton is secretly working for Forbes, both as hired security as well as to
      help Forbes discover who has been stealing from him. He suspects Lette, but has
      not confronted the Gnome.
      

      *Alibi*


      He was hired to protect Forbes. He stood guard with Stoker after Georgina was
      "attacked", and Cochran will vouch for his good character.

      *Secret*


      Dr. Coghill has for some time been dependent on a cocktail of muscle relaxants and

      *Bio*


      The owner of several smaller distilleries, Forbes' delivery cart accidentally killed
      George Pabst a little over a year ago. While tragic, the accident had the fortunate
      consequence that it gave Forbes an opportunity to meet, and later marry, Georgina Pabst
      and her not inconconsequential fortune and social status.


      *Secret*


      Forbes' real name is Cyril Weddal, a known racketeer and criminal. He murdered
      George Pabst in order to rid himself of a potential financial problem, and took
      advantage of his widow's grief to inject himself into her life and grant his
      cover businesses an air of respectability.

      caught in her sights with inane stories about her daughter and her former and
      current husbands. Despite everything, she is a good natured person at heart, and
      has been called "The Unsinkable Mrs. Pabst" both due to her tenaciousness as well
      as her "buoyant" personality.


      *Secret*


      Mrs. Pabst learned that Forbes killed her previous husband on purpose, and has
      been plotting revenge for some time now. She conspired with Iris to rid each other
      of their mutual problems while on the Express.

      *Bio*


      A former wagon driver, Uleaven saw an early steam engine at his family's forge
      and immediately realized that was where the future lay. With only a handful of
      gold pieces in his pocket, he set out to Glacierheart to learn all he could
      about them. He now owns a successful steam engine fabrication shop, and is looking
      to expand to Blackpoint


      *Secret*


      Uleaven was one shaken down by Forbes (Weddal) and recognized him on the train.
      He left a threatening note, meaning only to upset Forbes.
      

      *Alibi*


      He was sick and kept Dunn up all night.

      *Bio*


      A distinguished parliamentarian, MEP Learmonth has served for over 50 years,
      earning a well-deserved reputation as an iron-willed, shrewd, and dignified
      diplomat and politician. She is known among her supporters and detractors alike
      as "The Iron Toad", much to her great displeasure.


      *Secret*


      She has promised to help Iris stay in the Republic, but she is facing a tough
      re-election campaign and does not want the scandal of the murders to tarnish
      her hard-earned reputation.
      

      *Alibi*


      She was with Gibbs throughout the night in her quarters. She is too weak to have
      dealt the death blows to Forbes.
      

      *Notable*


      She wears a large red sash with gold embroidery reading "Member Elector of Parliament"
      that is almost as large as she is.

      *Bio*


      The daughter of a minor aristocratic family in Anacreon, Iris always resented that
      her only worth was as a potential bride to richer and more powerful families. She
      longs for the freedom and independence she experienced within the Republic, and wants
      nothing more than to stay.


      *Secret*


      She had planned to escape her marriage and stay in the Republic as an Asylumn seeker,
      possibly under an assumed identity, until she and Mrs. Pabst bonded over their mutual
      hatred of the men that had wronged them. She killed Forbes while he was comatose.
      

      *Alibi*


      She is known to take sleeping draughts and potions every night. Mat Stoker saw her
      drink one such vial the night of the murder, but unbeknownst to him, it was a fake.

      *Bio*


      An ambassador from the tiny midwest kingdom of Anacreon, Lige is fascinated
      by the Republic's unique form of First Age worship which he finds charmingly
      quaint. He is tired of the society though, with all their radical ideas and
      careless diregard for the proper order. He was pleased when his recall papers
      came through.


      *Secret*


      He is leaving behind several large gambling debts, some to Forbes'
      less-than-legitimate businesses. He has been abusive towards Iris behind closed
      doors, and while he is known to have a temper, the full extent has been suppressed.

      *Bio*


      Parrót is a famous actor from Blackpoint, well known for his unique portrayal
      of detectives. Based entirely on his work with the City Guard and the Knights
      Templar, Parrót channels the gritty underdark of Blackpoint into his characters,
      giving them a brutal reality sorely lacking from his contemporaries' portrayals.


      *Secret*


      None.
      

      *Alibi*


      A suitable alibi should be concocted for Parrót depending on the amount of
      knowledge he should have. He can assist Cochran with the inspection, or go
      with Wright to assist passengers / lift morale.
      

      *Notable*


      He is either extremely useless, and can be used to hint that a particular
      train of thought is fruitless, or he can be useful but cryptic, simply
      serving as a hint-dropping mechanism. He's really meant as a joke / hint
      mechanism.

      Iris and Dr. Cochran sit together. Iris discusses her restlessness and lack of
      sleep aboard trains. Dr. Cochran gives her a sleeping draught. Lige sits with them.


      MEP Learmonth and Elsa Gibb are absent. They are in the MEP's compartment. The MEP
      enjoys listening to Gibb read before going to bed.


      Cochran sits alone, but welcomes company. He will discuss the company's past, and will
      answer any questions about the line or the company.


      Pabst, Hays, and Forbes sit together. Pabst tells inane stories. Pabst will "kidnap"
      any player she fancies and forces them to dine with her. She reveals readily that
      she is on her first year anniversary, and that her previous husband was killed in
      an accident with Forbes' delivery wagon. She further reveals that Forbes came to call
      on her daily shortly after the accident, eventually leading to their marriage.


      Lige and Forbes stare daggers at each other the entire supper from across separate tables.


      Pinkerton is absent from dinner. He is inspecting Forbes' compartment while everyone is
      distracted. He will then do a run of the train to check for known faces in the other cars.


      Lette and Dunn sit alone in silence. They will not offer much conversation.


      Mat Stoker and Rush Wright will be transferring baggage to the baggage car as requested,
      and will otherwise return to their compartment during supper.


      Forbes, Lette, and Dunn leave early to review earnings documents in Forbes' compartment.


      Iris will leave early to discuss asylum with the MEP under the guise of a social visit.

      Iris and Pabst dine together, and bond over their shared love of the Republic's
      greater freedoms. They will shortly retire to the observation car to discuss their
      mutual marriage problems and concoct the murder plot. The women will make polite
      conversation, but will make it clear they wish to be alone.


      Rand and Labey eat in tense silence across a pair of adjacent tables. They will not
      offer much conversation.


      Coghill and Hays exchange medical stories, with the former starting to get the hang
      of deciphering the latter's sounds into something resembling speech.


      Pinkerton searches Uleaven's quarters with Dunn, as both suspect that the Half-Orc is
      clearly a hired goon in a ridiculous disguise. They will find nothing.


      Uleaven tries to rope Lige into a joint business venture, but the latter will
      tersely decline, citing the impropriety of it. Uleaven will finish breakfast
      with Cochran if possible, discussing their shared admiration of the wonders of
      steam.


      Lette and Forbes will pour over financial records all throughout breakfast.


      MEP Learmonth and Gibbs will eat together, with the latter ordering complicated
      special requests. The MEP and Gibbs will discuss the Blackpoint situation and
      the upcoming General Election.


      Stoker and Wright are off duty during breakfast.

      to point the party in a particular direction, either by actually helping or by
      being so clearly incompetent that nothing he says can possibly be accurate, thereby
      steering the party away from a particular fruitless line.

    Text : >-
      Iris and MEP Learmonth sit together and discuss the Republic. Gibb sits with them
      but doesn't contribute much.


      Rand, Hays, and Cochran are held hostage to Mrs. Pabst's conversation.


      Forbes and Lette take a break. Forbes and Dunn dine in silence. Lette joins
      Lige and Labey.


      Uleaven leaves early, complaining of abdominal pain.


      Coghill will follow him shortly after summoning Stoker to fetch his medical kit.


      Lige and Labey have an argument, causing Lige to storm off. The argument is spurred
      by the two parties' drasticly different interpretation of the "natural order". Lette
      and Labey hit it off pretty well, despite some disagreements.

      At a signal junction, the Express is sidelined to make way for a barging troop
      transport. The junction flags indicate that there has been a monster attack down
      the line, and military necessities trump passanger services.

      The Express is still sidelined until the line is cleared.
      

      Forbes and Pabst dine with Lige and Iris. They have a hushed conversation where
      Lige and Forbes agree to meet at around 1:30 AM to settle the outstanding
      gambling debts.


      MEP Learmonth and Dr. Coghill dine, and discuss their shared interest in Iris'
      wellbeing, albeit in polite and hushed tones so as not to be overheard.


      Uleaven is missing. Stoker and Coghill will affirm that Uleaven is sick and
      resting in his berth.


      Rand and Labey are in the observation car, pretending not to know one another
      while carrying on a tense conversation. They are not doing a good job of pretending.


      Lette and Dunn dine in silence.


      Cochran, Stoker, and Wright are in the baggage car with the other conductors,
      discussing the delay and how it will impact the train's timetable.


      Hays dines alone, but she seems unfazed by it.


      Pinkerton is absent, as it is becoming increasingly common. He is searching Lette's
      room, and has found evidence that it is Letter that is stealing from Forbes. He also
      finds evidence that Forbes killed George Pabst over a business dispute. He will not
      reveal his findings to Forbes, as he needs time to decide whether he's working for
      the right person or not.


      Forbes, Lette, and Dunn will stay in the Restaurant car until suppertime, going over
      paperwork.

      The flags are updated as the line is finally cleared. The Express resumes its
      journey. Cochran has ordered the engineers to try to make up time, and open up
      the throttle.


      The weather has taken a turn for the worse though, and a heavy blizzard is descending
      upon the area. Stoker and Wright inform the passengers of the new timetable, and
      offer some complimentary hot drinks.

      Pabst and Hays are missing. They are chatting in Hays' room, and snacking on
      some cheese and bread brought by Wright.


      Lette, Dunn, and Forbes continue to go over documents.


      Learmonth and Iris sit at a far table and discuss the mechanisms of asylumn in
      general terms.


      Rand and Labey share a light snack in the observation car. They haven't left since
      dinner.


      Pinkerton pays Uleaven a visit to try to pump him for information under the guise
      of a friendly visit. He discounts the sick Half-Orc as a threat, and gives him
      some contacts that could be useful in Blackpoint as an apology for wasting his time.


      Coghill retrieves a new batch of sleeping draughts from his private locker in the
      baggage car. He visibly takes one before leaving the restaurant car, but if asked 
      will claim to have had a headache. Back at the He also hands one vial to Stoker and
      asks him to deliver it to Iris later that evening when she retires.


      Lige is in his room, fuming.


      Cochran is making the rounds along the train, thanking all the passengers for
      their patience and offering apologies for the delay.


      Forbes orders a coffee to be brought to him at 11:30 PM, to his compartment.

      Iris will leave early, and receive the draught from Stoker. She asks him to bring
      her some water, and while he is gone, swaps the draught with a placebo. She drinks
      the fake potion in front of him when he returns.


      Pabst will return to her compartment before the end of supper, where she picks up
      a draught Iris left in the end priv. She returns to the restaurant car and orders
      a warm milk, and while the attendant is distracted, spikes the readied coffee for
      Forbes. If for some reason she is caught, she will claim that she is only doing it
      to make sure Forbes gets some sleep, as he has been staying up all night to go
      over paperwork.


      Stoker picks up the coffee and delivers it not a few moments later. Forbes will
      quickly down the cup and notice nothing.


      Lette and Dunn will be dismissed by Forbes as the latter wants some privacy to review
      some of the less-than-legal business books. He will quickly find himself overcome with
      exhaustion, but given his lack of sleep recently he won't find it too suspicious. He'll
      decide to take a short nap as the sleeping draught hits him.


      On his way back, Lette runs into Labey and Rand, who are returning from the Observation
      Car. Lette invites Labey to discuss politics. The dragonborn accepts and bids Rand a
      polite goodbye.

    Text : >-
      As the blizzard rages on, the Express hits a snowbank that has built up on the rails.
      Although the snow gives, it lifts and halts the train, causing the engine to derail. The
      passengers will feel a harsh deceleration. Some people will receive minor bumps and
      bruises, and a few will get more serious injuries, often from falling or being struck
      by a heavy object knocked loose.


      Stoker and Wright will check on the passengers in the cars, and being making
      announcements of another delay while the state of the Express is examined. Before Stoker
      heads to the locomotive, MEP Learmonth will summon him, and ask him to fetch Gibb. He
      wakes her and transmits the message before heading to the engine at 12:15 AM with Cochran.


      Wright heads to the other passenger cars to take over for a conductor who was struck
      by a heavy suitcase and needs to rest.

      Iris uses her minor magical training to disguise herself as Stoker, and dons a stolen
      Conductor's uniform. She accidentally bumps into Gibb as the latter reports to Learmonth's
      cabin.


      At 12:25 AM, Stoker returns from the locomotive and announces that the train has derailed.
      He announces it to the various compartments, and excuses himself to continue assessing
      the damage.


      Going through the connecting door in Pabst's room, Iris enters Forbes' compartment,
      and finds him unconscious. She stabs Forbes several times at 12:26 AM. She opens the
      window, hoping to confuse the investigation. She then hides the knife in the compartment
      after wiping it down.
      

      At 12:28 AM, she crosses the connecting door again and leaves. She returns to her
      compartment after hiding the stolen uniform in an empty compartment (only if Hercules
      Parrót is not aboard, otherwise she will hide the uniform in Gibb's room).

      Lige leaves his room to talk to Forbes and settle the debts. He slips into the dark
      cabin, and discovers the body when he opens the Ichor lamp shutters. He knows that he
      will be implicated, and decides to steal and destroy any evidence of his debt before
      leaving.


      At 1:10 AM, Stoker accidentally rings the conductor's bell. Stoker, who had recently
      returned, answers, but is told by Lige (pretending to be Forbes) it was a mistake.


      At 1:26 AM, Lige accidentally triggers a Glyph of Warding, which activates a Scorching
      Ray spell that kills him.


      At 1:30 AM, after hearing the Glyph go off, Pabst frantically rings the bell, claiming
      that she felt a man in her compartment. Stoker attempts to calm her down, and tries
      to fetch Dr. Coghill without success (the Dr. is knocked out by his sleeping draught).
      Pinkerton notices the worried conductor, and joins him to stand guard outside Mrs.
      Pabst's door until morning.

      When Lette and Dunn are unable to rouse Forbes for breakfast, they fetch Stoker
      Cochran, and Coghill, and use the Conductor's key to open the compartment. They are
      shocked to discover the two bodies, and the investigation begins.
