title : Murder on the Stonhyr Express
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Stonhyr Express is the premier rail service between Siddar City
    and Blackpoint at the tail end of the 8th Century AGS. The line is
    operated by the International Company of Sleeping Cars, I.C.S.C., by
    license of the Trans-Siddar Railroad, the Republic's semi-public rail
    corporation.


    This module focuses on a particularly unfortunate trip on the Sixth Day
    before the Ides of the Twelfth Moon of the Year 795 AGS (6IDE 3M 795Y).
    The Express, delayed due to a higher-precedence military rail convoy, is
    caught in a terrible blizzard West of Featherfurth, and derails on a
    snowbank. The following morning, two murders are discovered in the First
    Class sleeping car. What looks like an argument over gambling debts gone
    bad is quickly revealed as a double homicide, and with the blizzard raging,
    the killer must still be onboard.

      *Bio*


      A former detective for the Siddar City Gendarmerie, Cochran was
      an early investor in the burgeoning railways of the Republic,
      making him fantastically wealthy. After his forced retirement,
      Cochran founded the International Company of Sleeping Cars with
      a group of investors, spurred by the dream of luxurious rail travel.


      *Secret*


      The I.C.S.C. Board has threatened to remove Cochran from the
      directorship if the company stock misses yet another earnings
      forecast. The news of an unsolved pair of murders on the train
      would be disastrous for public perception in the company.


      *Alibi*


      Cochran's dominant hand has no strength due to an accident during
      his days at the Gendarmerie. Additionally, he was with Mat Stoker
      and the engineers in the locomotive at the time of the crimes.


      *Notable*


      Silver Gray suit bearing the company lapel pin. Right hand doesn't
      clench. Right Handed, but learned to use Left.

      *Bio*


      A veteran of the recent Western Conflicts, Col. Labey holds an automatic distrust
      bordering on outright xenophobia of foreigners. Dohlarans are only barely a step
      above the Western savages in his book. He was Katherine Rand's former superior
      officer during her youth in the military.


      *Secret*

      He is deeply in love with Ms. Rand, and has been secretly seeing her despite the
      risks to both (he was never implicated in the scandal that kicked her out of the
      Army, but could stand court martial for hiding it ever since).
      
      

      *Alibi*


      He was with Lette all throughout the night of the crime, beyond Pinkerton's suite.
      

      *Notable*

      He wears an Army dress uniform. Left Handed

      *Bio*


      A strict governess, Katherine has tried to escape a sordid past as a dishonorably
      discharged draftee. She's relied on a new name and an adopted identity to ensure
      she can find jobs as a governess. She is trying to move westward where it is less
      likely she will be recognized and revealed.


      *Secret*


      She was dishonorably discharged from the Army for getting romantically involved
      with a superior officer (Col. Labey), and failing to disclose his identity when
      investigated.
      

      *Alibi*


      She was beyond Pinkerton's suite at the time of the murders.

      Luther Lette was a promising law student, but his excessive love for inebriating
      drinks caused the University to expell him. He has taken odd secretarial jobs
      ever since to make ends meet.


      *Secret*


      Lette has been embezzling from Forbes for the past year, both out of greed and
      out of hatred, as he knows Forbes killed George Pabst on purpose.

      The son of a decorated Gendarme Detective, Merl decided at an early age
      not to follow directly in his father's gootsteps, and instead launched
      an early form of the private detective agency. He is well known among
      the Gendarme as an expert sleuth, but has managed to keep his name relatively
      well hidden from the general consciousness.


      *Secret*

      
      Pinkerton is secretly working for Forbes, both as hired security as well as to
      help Forbes discover who has been stealing from him. He suspects Lette, but has
      not confronted the Gnome.
      

      *Alibi*


      He was hired to protect Forbes. He stood guard with Stoker after Georgina was
      "attacked", and Cochran will vouch for his good character.

      *Secret*


      Dr. Coghill has for some time been dependent on a cocktail of muscle relaxants and

      *Bio*


      The owner of several smaller distilleries, Forbes' delivery cart accidentally killed
      George Pabst a little over a year ago. While tragic, the accident had the fortunate
      consequence that it gave Forbes an opportunity to meet, and later marry, Georgina Pabst
      and her not inconconsequential fortune and social status.


      *Secret*


      Forbes' real name is Cyril Weddal, a known racketeer and criminal. He murdered
      George Pabst in order to rid himself of a potential financial problem, and took
      advantage of his widow's grief to inject himself into her life and grant his
      cover businesses an air of respectability.

      caught in her sights with inane stories about her daughter and her former and
      current husbands. Despite everything, she is a good natured person at heart, and
      has been called "The Unsinkable Mrs. Pabst" both due to her tenaciousness as well
      as her "buoyant" personality.


      *Secret*


      Mrs. Pabst learned that Forbes killed her previous husband on purpose, and has
      been plotting revenge for some time now. She conspired with Iris to rid each other
      of their mutual problems while on the Express.

      *Bio*


      A former wagon driver, Uleaven saw an early steam engine at his family's forge
      and immediately realized that was where the future lay. With only a handful of
      gold pieces in his pocket, he set out to Glacierheart to learn all he could
      about them. He now owns a successful steam engine fabrication shop, and is looking
      to expand to Blackpoint


      *Secret*


      Uleaven was one shaken down by Forbes (Weddal) and recognized him on the train.
      He left a threatening note, meaning only to upset Forbes.
      

      *Alibi*


      He was sick and kept Dunn up all night.

      considers the MEP to be the mother she never had.


      *Secret*


      None, but she is entirely loyal to the MEP.

      *Bio*


      A distinguished parliamentarian, MEP Learmonth has served for over 50 years,
      earning a well-deserved reputation as an iron-willed, shrewd, and dignified
      diplomat and politician. She is known among her supporters and detractors alike
      as "The Iron Toad", much to her great displeasure.


      *Secret*


      She has promised to help Iris stay in the Republic, but she is facing a tough
      re-election campaign and does not want the scandal of the murders to tarnish
      her hard-earned reputation.
      

      *Alibi*


      She was with Gibbs throughout the night in her quarters. She is too weak to have
      dealt the death blows to Forbes.
      

      *Notable*


      She wears a large red sash with gold embroidery reading "Member Elector of Parliament"
      that is almost as large as she is.

      *Bio*


      The daughter of a minor aristocratic family in Anacreon, Iris always resented that
      her only worth was as a potential bride to richer and more powerful families. She
      longs for the freedom and independence she experienced within the Republic, and wants
      nothing more than to stay.


      *Secret*


      She had planned to escape her marriage and stay in the Republic as an Asylumn seeker,
      possibly under an assumed identity, until she and Mrs. Pabst bonded over their mutual
      hatred of the men that had wronged them. She killed Forbes while he was comatose.
      

      *Alibi*


      She is known to take sleeping draughts and potions every night. Mat Stoker saw her
      drink one such vial the night of the murder, but unbeknownst to him, it was a fake.

      *Bio*


      An ambassador from the tiny midwest kingdom of Anacreon, Lige is fascinated
      by the Republic's unique form of First Age worship which he finds charmingly
      quaint. He is tired of the society though, with all their radical ideas and
      careless diregard for the proper order. He was pleased when his recall papers
      came through.


      *Secret*


      He is leaving behind several large gambling debts, some to Forbes'
      less-than-legitimate businesses. He has been abusive towards Iris behind closed
      doors, and while he is known to have a temper, the full extent has been suppressed.

    Text : >-
      Iris and Dr. Cochran sit together. Iris discusses her restlessness and lack of
      sleep aboard trains. Dr. Cochran gives her a sleeping draught. Lige sits with them.


      MEP Learmonth and Elsa Gibb are absent. They are in the MEP's compartment. The MEP
      enjoys listening to Gibb read before going to bed.


      Cochran sits alone, but welcomes company. He will discuss the company's past, and will
      answer any questions about the line or the company.


      Pabst, Hays, and Forbes sit together. Pabst tells inane stories. Pabst will "kidnap"
      any player she fancies and forces them to dine with her. She reveals readily that
      she is on her first year anniversary, and that her previous husband was killed in
      an accident with Forbes' delivery wagon. She further reveals that Forbes came to call
      on her daily shortly after the accident, eventually leading to their marriage.


      Lige and Forbes stare daggers at each other the entire supper from across separate tables.


      Pinkerton is absent from dinner. He is inspecting Forbes' compartment while everyone is
      distracted. He will then do a run of the train to check for known faces in the other cars.


      Lette and Dunn sit alone in silence. They will not offer much conversation.


      Mat Stoker and Rush Wright will be transferring baggage to the baggage car as requested,
      and will otherwise return to their compartment during supper.


      Forbes, Lette, and Dunn leave early to review earnings documents in Forbes' compartment.


      Iris will leave early to discuss asylum with the MEP under the guise of a social visit.

          - Col. Isham Labey

      - Group 2

      Uleaven will accidentally hop in the wrong bunk and startle Dunn. They do not enjoy

      Iris and Pabst dine together, and bond over their shared love of the Republic's
      greater freedoms. They will shortly retire to the observation car to discuss their
      mutual marriage problems and concoct the murder plot. The women will make polite
      conversation, but will make it clear they wish to be alone.


      Rand and Labey eat in tense silence across a pair of adjacent tables. They will not
      offer much conversation.


      Coghill and Hays exchange medical stories, with the former starting to get the hang
      of deciphering the latter's sounds into something resembling speech.


      Pinkerton searches Uleaven's quarters with Dunn, as both suspect that the Half-Orc is
      clearly a hired goon in a ridiculous disguise. They will find nothing.


      Uleaven tries to rope Lige into a joint business venture, but the latter will
      tersely decline, citing the impropriety of it. Uleaven will finish breakfast
      with Cochran if possible, discussing their shared admiration of the wonders of
      steam.


      Lette and Forbes will pour over financial records all throughout breakfast.


      MEP Learmonth and Gibbs will eat together, with the latter ordering complicated
      special requests. The MEP and Gibbs will discuss the Blackpoint situation and
      the upcoming General Election.


      Stoker and Wright are off duty during breakfast.

      He is a celebrated actor who often portrays detectives. He is a tool for the GM

      steering the party away from a particular fruitless line.

      Iris and MEP Learmonth sit together and discuss the Republic. Gibb sits with them
      but doesn't contribute much.


      Rand, Hays, and Cochran are held hostage to Mrs. Pabst's conversation.


      Forbes and Lette continue to pour over documents. Dunn sits nearby, holding
      additional paperwork but otherwise uninvolved.


      Uleaven leaves early, complaining of abdominal pain.


      Coghill will follow him shortly after summoning Stoker to fetch his medical kit.


      Lige and Labey have an argument, causing Lige to storm off. The argument is spurred
      by the two parties' drasticly different interpretation of the "natural order".
