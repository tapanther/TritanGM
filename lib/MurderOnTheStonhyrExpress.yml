title : Murder on the Stonhyr Express
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    The Stonhyr Express is the premier rail service between Siddar City
    and Blackpoint at the tail end of the 8th Century AGS. The line is
    operated by the International Company of Sleeping Cars, I.C.S.C., by
    license of the Trans-Siddar Railroad, the Republic's semi-public rail
    corporation.


    This module focuses on a particularly unfortunate trip on the Sixth Day
    before the Ides of the Twelfth Moon of the Year 795 AGS (6IDE 3M 795Y).
    The Express, delayed due to a higher-precedence military rail convoy, is
    caught in a terrible blizzard West of Featherfurth, and derails on a
    snowbank. The following morning, two murders are discovered in the First
    Class sleeping car. What looks like an argument over gambling debts gone
    bad is quickly revealed as a double homicide, and with the blizzard raging,
    the killer must still be onboard.

      #### Bio


      A former detective for the Siddar City Gendarmerie, Cochran was
      an early investor in the burgeoning railways of the Republic,
      making him fantastically wealthy. After his forced retirement,
      Cochran founded the International Company of Sleeping Cars with
      a group of investors, spurred by the dream of luxurious rail travel.


      #### Secret


      The I.C.S.C. Board has threatened to remove Cochran from the
      directorship if the company stock misses yet another earnings
      forecast. The news of an unsolved pair of murders on the train
      would be disastrous for public perception in the company.


      #### Alibi


      Cochran's dominant hand has no strength due to an accident during
      his days at the Gendarmerie. Additionally, he was with Mat Stoker
      and the engineers in the locomotive at the time of the crimes.


      #### Notable


      Silver Gray suit bearing the company lapel pin. Right hand doesn't
      clench.
