title : The Demon Core
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    Trapped within the golden mirror is the soul of an ancient and terrible
    demon. Where the Shroud provides the initial energy to the weapon, it is
    the Demon Core that empowers the truly apocalyptic devastation the weapon
    wreaks.


    The Demon Core, like all pieces of the weapon, was separated and hidden by
    Hermes Trismegistus prior to the Great Sack. Unbeknownst to anyone outside
    Hermes' inner circle, the Demon Core was not buried in a desolate area, but
    was instead entrusted into the care of Lord Symnyr Lynch, Councillor of
    Blackpoint and a long-time personal friend.


    As prolongued exposure to the Core is extremely hazardous, the sphere
    was placed inside a leaden sarcophagus, and hidden deep within the
    catacombs under the city. Since then, the existence of the Demon Core and
    its final resting place has been a closely guarded secret, known only
    to the office of the Blackpoint Councillor, and after the Great Sack,
    the Royal Chancellor that superseded the title.


    Discovering the location of the Demon Core's sarcophagus is no easy task.
    The catacombs are a twisting maze of passages and chambers, many of which
    have not been accessed in centuries. Many of the catacomb entrances were
    sealed during the Great Sack, and the rest are heavily guarded by the
    Dusk Templars. Breaking into the catacombs will be a difficult proposition,
    second only to breaking out with the sarcophagus.


    Alternatively, a diplomatic approach may be possible. The current
    Chancellor, Lord Reynfred, has been searching for information about the
    weapon, as have his predecessors. Although the Chancellor would use the
    weapon for his own purposes, the Lynch family remains the unofficial
    protectors of the Demon Core. Yrvyn Lynch serves as the Chancellor's
    clerk, has access to his ancestor's records, and has been looking for a way
    to secure the Demon Core from the Chancellor's grasp.

    Title : Reaching Blackpoint
    Subtitle : Black Highway
    Text : >-
      Blackpoint lies at the Southwestern terminus of the Black Highway, the
      largest trade route in Easter Tritan, connecting the two capitals of
      Blackpoint and Siddar City. The road is wide, well maiantained, and
      most importantly, safe. The road is constantly patrolled by the Dusk
      Templars up until the Republic takes over some distance past Ravenhelm.


      The road passes through several small towns, but none are particularly
      worthy of note. Many of the towns have little to offer other than simple
      agricultural products and raw materials. As the towns get closer to
      Blackpoint, the attitude becomes colder and less receptive. The small
      villages just outside the city practically stare down any outsiders that
      wander through.

    Subtitle : Gates of Blackpoint
    Text : >-
      As Blackpoint is composed of interlocking walled enclaves, the outer gates
      of the city are but the first of many checkpoints the party will need to
      pass in order to get access to the city proper.


      There are a dozen or so outer gates open at any given time, but only four
      have a customs station where non-citizens can gain the paperwork
      necessary to traverse through the city. These four gates are located on
      enclaves that were destroyed during the Great Sack, and still show much
      of the damage today.
  -
    separate : False
    Subtitle : Blackpoint Village Inns
    Text : >-
      Near each of the main four gates is a small inn, where visitors to the
      city can spend the night and get some rest from the long journey. Unlike
      the nearby villages, these inns depend entirely on foreign visitors, and
      extend them every courtesy.

      
      The innkeepers vary, but they are all pleasant and charming, a stark
      contrast to the surrounding villagers. Typical names for the innkeepers
      are Sean, Anraoi, Paidi, Eithne, Aibell, or Eimear. A short conversation
      with the inkeepers reveals that the entrances to the city are limited
      for foreigners, and few are allowed in without prior business in the
      city.


      A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check with the inkeeper can reveal some
      useful information to enter the city with fewer complications.
      The table below has some options for what the inkeeper may reveal,
      or if the party rolls well, may be options he presents the party.
      Alternatively, a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the
      inn's patrons may reveal similar information.
    Table :
      1-7 : >-
        The inkeeper knows a merchant willing to pretend they are part of his
        security escort - for a price (1000 gp). He will take the party as far
        as the outer enclaves where his destination lies.
      8-15 : >-
        The inkeeper knows that one of the Crown inspectors (Sioda) at the 
        Station has a sick daughter, and may be willing to look the other way
        in exchange for some money for medicine (500 gp). The inspector will
        furnish the party with temporary entry permits, good for a pair of
        days.
      16-20 : >-
        The inkeeper reveals that one of the patrons has been selling forged
        entry permits (250 gp). The forgeries will withstand a moderate degree
        of scrutiny, but should provide access to the inner city.

    Subtitle : Customs Station
    Text : >-
      The Customs Stations are only open between sunrise and sunset. Any
      travelers arriving outside those hours are directed by the guards
      on duty to one of the nearby inns.


      Once it is daytime, the Customs Station is open, and the guards will
      usher everyone without a valid entry permit into the small guardhouse
      where the inspector is located.

              (500gp).

      Without some additional help through the checkpoint, the party will
      be required to leave their weapons at the Customs Station, to be
      retrieved upon exit. Only licensed caravan guards to known merchants
      are allowed to keep their weapons. The gate is guarded by about 15
      soldiers, with dozens of Dusk Templars only moments away. Trying to
      break through the checkpoint will throw the enclave into lockdown, and
      immediately make the party wanted enemies of the Dohlaran Crown. This will
      make it much harder to avoid detection and can introduc complications
      once inside the city.


      Additionally, ancient magic items
      are expressly forbidden, and will be confiscated and not returned
      if discovered. This information is common knowledge, and the party
      should take care not to have such items on their person. In the interests
      of greater diplomacy, the inspectors will remind the party of this fact
      and allow them to come back another day when they are better prepared.
      

      The inspector on duty will thoroughly check the party, requiring a
      DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check
      for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon through. If caught,
      the weapon(s) will be removed and placed in the depository. Should a
      member of the party attempt to smuggle a weapon through again, the
      entire party will have their passes revoked, and will need to try again
      in about a week's time.

    Title : Inside the Outer Enclaves
    Text : >-
      The outermost enclaves of the city were almost entirely destroyed
      by Baltatrax during the Great Sack. Many of the buildings are
      significantly newer and of a different architecture than those inside
      the inner city. The outer enclaves tend to be a mix of poorer housing
      and industries. Many merchants have supply contracts here, and
      accomodations and supplies may be easily found.



      Travel between the outer enclaves is not restricted, and permits are
      rarely checked. These enclaves are typically run by the local nobility,
      who are less willing to spend more than is necessary on security, and
      there are plenty of warehouses and shanties to hide in should the need
      arise.
  -
    Subtitle : Ruined Districts
    Text : >-
      Some of the enclaves were far too damaged during the Great Sack, and
      have been converted into makeshift residences for many of the city's
      workers. Contrary to the common perception, these people are generally
      friendly and respectful to foreginers, whom they view with mild
      curiosity and a great deal of deference. Travelers are often addressed
      as 'my lord' or 'my lady', regardless of any true claim to nobility.


      Since many people's impression of Blackpoint comes from the outer
      villages or the nobility within, there is an assumption that the entirety
      of the citizenry shares a similar disdain for foreigners. It is not true
      to say, however, that the common folk think favorably of strangers. It's
      simply that the average commoner within the walls is secure in the knowledge
      that Blackpoint would never allow "the wrong sort of people" to stay, and
      anyone passing through is more of a temporary curiosity. To the common
      folk, decency and kindness are entirely unrelated to acceptance and tolerance.

    Subtitle : Gardhynyr Trade House
    Text : >-
      The Gahrdynyr Trade House, one of the major trading organizations
      within the Republic, has a major depot here. If the party has good
      relations with the Republic, they may have been gifted a letter of
      introduction, or even a Republic Warrant, which can be presented
      to the intendant at the Gardhynyr Trade House, Orval Morrissy.


      The intendant doesn't officially run the trade house, but he has
      the most up to date and accurante information, as he is the primary
      contact for merchants and local businessmen. A DC 15 Charisma
      (Persuasion) check can gain the party a lot of valuable information
      about the city, including the local layout. With a suitable introduction,
      the intendant will be much more forthcoming, allowing the party to roll
      with advantage. A warrant grants automatic success, as the intendant
      is entirely loyal to the Republic.


      If the party inquires about more than just basics about the city, or
      directly asks about the catacombs or information related to the
      Demon Core, the intendant will suggest that the party visit the
      Crown Libraries within the Inner Enclaves, as that is the most likely
      place to find information about the history of the kingdom and the
      city. He will point out however that entering the Inner Enclaves is
      not a privilege extended to every traveler, and that special permits,
      such as those granted to trade company representatives.


      The intendant can supply the party with additional paperwork to allow
      them easier travel into the inner city. The paperwork identifies
      the party as trade representatives, and for all intents and purposes
      is genuine. Without a warrant, the intendant will want some form of
      compensation for the paperwork, but he is not interested in money.
      He wants a magic item, forbidden contraband within the city, and he's
      not too particular about what he gets.


      If the party may not have a magic item they are willing to part with,
      the intendant knows of some confiscated items at a local guardhouse
      that haven't been logged yet. It seems a merchant was foolish enough
      to attempt to hide the items, and was promptly discovered.

    Subtitle : Outer Enclave Guardhouse
    Text : >-
      The guardhouse is located within the commercial zone, and is normally
      staffed by 20 guards, although many more can be called in case of
      an emergency. The guards mostly handle petty crimes, and don't suspect
      any kind of trouble will arise.


      At the depository of the guardhouse is a small trove of about a half
      dozen minor magic items, any of which will satisfy the intendant. 
  -
    Text : |
      To get to the depository, the party will need to:
        
      - Sneak into the guardhouse ...
          - ... during the day   : DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check
          - ... during the night : DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check
          - Getting a layout of the guardhouse and guard rotations with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can grant advantage.
      - Distract the guard at the repository entrance
      - Unlock the depository where the items are held with a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
          - The depository guard has a set of keys, which can be lifted with a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
      - Leave the guardhouse without alerting the guards.
  -
    Text : >-
      Additional complications may arise if the party is discovered. The
      guards will turn hostile, and the party can become wanted if they fight
      with the guards. It is possible that the party becomes notorious in
      Blackpoint, which will put guards on alert for persons matching the
      party's last known description.


      Here are some additional encounters that may arise while the party
      is retrieving the magic items from the depository:

        No additional encounters.

        1d6 + 3 Dusk Templars arrive at the guardhouse.
      19 : >-
        The guards conduct a random inspection of the building. The party can
        avoid detection with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check.
      20 : >-
        A thief is already in the process of stealing the magic items.

    Subtitle : Inner Enclave Checkpoint
    Text: >-
      Each enclave is connected to its neighbors via another large, well protected
      gate. Travel into the Inner Enclaves requires the appropriate paperwork, which
      can be obtained either via forged documents or by helping the Gahrdynyr Trade
      House intendant. Attempting to break through the checkpoints into the Inner
      Enclaves will result in the party becoming enemies of the Crown, and will
      unleash the full fury of the city's defenses.


      With the appropriate paperwork, the party will once again be inspected as they
      are considered untrustworthy foreigners. requiring a
      DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check
      for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon or magic item through.


      It is possible to circumvent the need for permits, though this carries
      significant risk.


      Most of the poorer citizens of the Outer Enclaves do not
      have paperwork themselves, but some of the richer merchants and travelers
      may have paperwork that matches the party's general descriptions. These
      permits may be pickpocketed by a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
      check. A failed check alerts the owner, who will cry for help against the
      would-be thief.

      
      Alternatively, the checkpoint itself could be bypassed, either by going
      over the walls, DC 15 Strength (Athletics), or through them with the
      appropriate spells. However, the guards in the Inner Enclaves will
      occasionally stop-check foreigners for paperwork, which can create
      complications if the permits are not produced.

    Title : Inside the Inner Enclaves
    Text : >-
      Unlike the Outer Enclaves, the inner sectors of Blackpoint are extremely
      well maintained, offering many beautiful sights of antecasum architecture.
      The citizens privileged enough to live in the Inner Enclaves are generally
      wealthy merchants, artesans, freemen, and the lower nobility. These
      enclaves are typically better patrolled and protected, and anyone who does
      not appear to belong can expect to present their permits several times
      throughout the day.


      Similar to the Outer Enclaves, travel within the same ring is significantly
      more relaxed. Permits typically do not need to be presented, unless an
      Enclave has been sealed due to a policing action, which is extremely rare.
      Travel to the Outer Enclaves is similarly unrestricted, though the guards
      will remind well-to-do citizens not to linger or leave the main boulevards
      that connect the inner checkpoints with the outer gates.

    Subtitle : Crown Library
    Text : >-
      One of the Inner Enclaves is the site of the former Royal Academy, once a
      prestigious magical university. The Academy was shuttered during
      the Spellplague and the Great Sack, and many of its priceless tomes and
      artifacts were removed by the Crown.


      Since the Great Sack, the Crown has used the Academy grounds for various
      purposes throughout the years. Some of the buildings were used as warehouses
      for military goods, and the dormitories were repurposed as barracks for the
      Dohlaran Army at the height of the crisis. The various libraries and great
      halls were used as archives for the Crown's documents and records, but over
      time became general repositories for printed materials, and were eventually
      opened to a limited subset of the public as the Crown Library.


      Unless the party is clearly out of place within the Inner Enclaves, there
      should be no difficulty entering the libraries. Inside the Academy Enclave,
      paperwork is rarely checked, as the Academy grounds are not considered
      particularly restricted. It is possible to sneak into the libraries at night,
      as the grounds are not well illuminated and security is fairly lax.


      !!! tip
          Yrvyn Lynch, the Chancellor's Clerk and descendant of Symnyr Lynch,
          can often be found inside the library as part of his job. He may
          notice the party's research and approach them, as his family considers
          it their sacred duty to safeguard the Demon Core until it is needed.
          He can be recruited by presenting evidence that the party is affiliated
          with Hermes Trismegistus or Azoth the Wise.


      Once inside the library, the clerks can help the party find the appropriate
      records, but will become suspicious if the party asks too many direct
      questions about the catacombs, the Chancellor, the Demon Core, or any closely
      related subject.


      !!! warning
          The librarians may warn the Chancellor if they become too suspicious of
          the party's motives. They will claim that the information may take a few
          hours to compile, and invite the party to return early the next day. If
          the party has met and recruited Yrvyn Lynch, he will already know to
          expect the report. Otherwise, Yrvyn will intercept the librarians' report
          and interview the party upon their return, to ascertain whether they
          are allies or enemies. He will bring a dozen Dusk Templars with him
          as protection, but will dismiss them if recruited.

      
      The records can be searched manually to avoid attracting attention to the
      party's activities, using Intelligence (Investigation or History) checks of
      the appropriate DC. Topics marked as restricted require a DC 14 Dexterity
      (Stealth) check to bypass the librarian in the restricted section.

              Dusk Templars and some of their tactics. Additionally, the requisition
              forms over the past few decades suggest that the Dusk Templars have
              begun to train arcane casters as part of their ranks.

    Subtitle : Crown Enclave Checkpoint
    Text : >-
      The innermost enclaves of Blackpoint are controlled directly by the
      Dohlaran Crown, and are off-limits to anyone without official business.
      Forged documents will not pass muster, and repeated failed attempts to
      pass with improper documentation will cause the party to become wanted.


      Short of bypassing the checkpoint entirely by sneaking over the enclave
      walls, the only way through is with an official invitation.


      If the party has met and recruited Yrvyn Lynch, he can provide the party
      with the necessary invitation as the Chancellor's clerk.


      The party can attempt to request an audience with the King by petitioning
      the local magistrates. If the party highlights their knowledge of faraway
      people and places in the petition, the King will most likely grant the
      audience, though it will take several days for an invitation to be issued.


      The Gahrdynyr Trade House intendant's papers can be used to request entrance,
      but only if the party has asked the intendant to set up an audience with
      the appropriate ministers.


      !!! tip
          If the catacombs, the Demon Core, or magical artifacts are brought up
          as part of the audience requests, Yrvyn Lynch has a standing order
          with all the ministerial clerks to route the audience request directly
          to himself, under the guise of secret orders from the Chancellor. He
          will interview the party directly, and attempt to ascertain whether they
          share a common goal, or whether they should be arrested on the spot.

      
      Regardless of the method of entry, the party should take care not to stray
      too far from their official destination. The Dusk Templars actively and
      thoroughly patrol the Crown Enclaves, checking for papers to anyone not
      wearing a small lapel pin that identifies them as Crown officials. Noticing
      the pattern (or the pins) requires a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception or Insight)
      check. Hiding from the patrols is extremely difficult, requiring a
      successful DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check, repeated in 10-minute intervals.

    Title : Crown Enclaves
    Text : >-
      The Crown Enclaves are the innermost enclaves, encompassing the palace
      grounds, the army headquarters, and the Crown offices that host the
      government. Very few people actually live in the Crown Enclaves, with only
      the royal family and the oldest Dohlaran noble families having any sort
      of permanent residence within.


      These enclaves are heavily patrolled by the Dusk Templars, and contain the
      only known entrances to the catacombs in which the Demon Core is hidden.
  -
    Subtitle : Crown Offices
    Text : >-
      If the party requested an audience that piqued the interest of Yrvyn Lynch,
      they are directed to the appropriate building within the Crown offices, where
      Yrvyn will be waiting, and will attempt to determine whether the party is on his
      side, or if they represent a threat to either himself or the Crown.


      Yrvyn is not disloyal to the Crown, but he believes that his family has a
      higher calling to protect the Demon Core until it is needed. He can be
      convinced to help the party by presenting evidence that they are on a quest
      for Hermes Trismegistus or Azoth the Wise. Simply mentioning them is insufficient,
      and he will immediately suspect that the party is searching for the Demon Core
      for nefarious purposes.


      Once convinced of the party's noble intentions, Yrvyn will suggest that they
      meet up in a more discreet location to continue the conversation. Yrvyn will
      suggest a suitable location if none is presented by the party.


      If the party did not happen upon Yrvyn, and meet with one of the ministers,
      they will quickly be dismissed and escorted out of the Crown Enclaves unless
      they can successfully bluff their way through the audience. Depending on how
      the party plays it, this can be a Charisma (Deception or Performance),
      Wisdom (Insight), or Intelligence (History), all at DC 25. A successful pass
      will allow them to remain on the Crown Enclaves without being escorted out.

    Subtitle : Meetup with Yrvyn
    Text : >-
      When the party rendezvous with Yrvyn, they can gain a great deal of information
      about the catacombs and the Demon Core's location. Yrvyn's great-great-great
      grandfather ordered the desruction of most of the official records when it
      became clear that the Crown could not be trusted with the artifact. Fortunately
      for the party, the Lynch family kept their own set of records, and although they
      could not save a map, there is a record of Symnyr's directions to reach the
      artifact's vault. He will also mention that some of the catacomb exits were
      hidden rather than sealed, and although their locations are unknown, it should
      be possible to exit the catacombs from a different location, possibly in the
      Outer Enclaves, but it would be next to impossible to find that exit from
      outside.


      Most importantly however, Yrvyn has keys to the various catacomb gates,
      which have been enchanted against picking and would otherwise require a
      DC 25 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to bypass, or a DC 15 check if
      Dispell or Knock are used on each gate.


      Lastly, Yrvyn can help create a distraction to draw away the Dusk Templars
      and allow the party to enter the catacombs more easily from within the
      Crown Enclaves.

    Title : Entering the Catacombs
    Text : >-
      There are about a half dozen catacomb entrances within the Crown Enclave,
      though only one is particularly suitable for the party to use. The entrance is
      located inside the Draseotheoa, a massive First Age temple to long forgotten
      gods.


      If the party has learned the location of the catacomb entrances from Yrvyn
      or some other source, they can head directly there. Otherwise, the party will
      need to explore the Crown Enclaves to try to locate the entrances. A DC 20
      Intelligence (History or Religion) check can provide insight that the catacombs
      would have been used as burial chambers during the First Age, and First Age temples
      would have been connected to the catacombs. 


      The best catacomb entrance is hidden underneath the statue of the Dragon God inside
      the Draseotheoa. Normally, a pair of Dusk Templars patrol the wing of the
      temple where the statue is located. If Yrvyn was recruited, these guards are
      not present. Otherwise the Dusk Templars will pass by the statue every 5 minutes.

    Subtitle : Draseotheoa
    Text : >-
      The Draseotheoa is the holiest site in Blackpoint. A massive First Age temple,
      the Draseotheoa boasts a massive central nave flanked by two rows of intricately
      carved columns. The stained glass windows that line the Aisles depict imagery
      of the Old Pantheon's miracles, though the accompanying lore has largely been
      lost to the ages. Two transepts flank the central altar, in which the idols
      and statues of the ancient gods are kept as a reminder of what once was. An
      octagonal chapterhouse abuts the choir, in which sits a colossal statue of
      a dragon.


      The statue of the Dragon God is a massive marble statue and one of the cultural
      treasures of Blackpoint. During the First Age, the Draseotheoa was constructed
      to honor the old pantheon, but as the city's patron god, the Dragon God
      was given a dedicated room in the temple.
      

      The statue bears a small inscription in draconic scratched behind the base,
      which reads:


      !!! quote
          Lips to lips, mouth to mouth,  
          Comes the speaker of the shrouds,  
          Suck in the spirit, speak the words,  
          Let secrets of the dead be heard.  


      Inspecting the statue's mouth, a small switch can be felt. When activated,
      a wall panel behind the statue reveals a secret door into the catacombs.

    Title : Catacombs of Blackpoint
    Text : >-
      The catacombs of Blackpoint refer to a massive complex of interconnected
      subterranean tunnels and chambers that serve as the final resting place of
      hundreds, if not thousands, of Blackpoint's paragons of the past millenia.


      Originally, the catacombs were a disjoint collection of mining tunnels and
      crypts that crisscrossed the ground beneath the city. Over the course of
      a thousand years, parts of the catacombs were found, forgotten, collapsed,
      expanded, or even sealed off, until a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers
      were left behind. No complete map of the catacombs has ever existed, but
      the most well known sections are the undercrofts beneath the surviving
      temples.


      During the Great Sack, most of the entrances to the catacombs were sealed or
      destroyed to prevent the invading hordes from using them to bypass the
      enclave walls. Only the Royal Crypts and the entraces within the Royal Enclaves
      were preserved, as the Crown planned to use the labyrinth in a last ditch
      attempt to survive should Baltatrax and his hordes breach the inner city.


      The catacombs beneath the Draseotheoa span three levels.


      The first level holds hundreds of First Age cadavers, mostly in small alcoves
      cut into the walls of the tunnels. Only the most honored of the dead were
      granted the privilege of a crypt or sarcophagus.


      The second level contains far fewer
      remains, mostly along the first set of tunnels leading to the first level.
      The Royal Crypts are located in the second level, along with the Royal Vaults,
      which house many of the Crown's ancient treasures.


      The third and final level was sealed shut behind a massive, warded gateway, under
      orders from Councillor Ermylynd Lynch in the First Century. In the Fifth Century,
      Morrin Lynch had all of the records pertaining to the third level destroyed, in
      order to keep the Demon Core's location hidden.

    Subtitle : Catacombs Level 1

      The first level of the Catacombs beneath the Draseotheoa connect to the rest
      of the catacomb network at many locations. This level is dominated by long,
      winding corridors lined with the remains of long forgotten heroes.

      The second level has far fewer remains than the first, and the layout is
      a little less haphazard. There are far fewer connections to the rest of the
      catacombs, having been constructed only once the first level was nearly full.

      The third and last level of the catacombs is far less impressive than the
      prior two, containing almost no loculi (wall graves), and only an occasional
      room with unmarked sarcophagi. The layout however is far more labyrinthean,
      seemingly designed with the intent of confounding anyone trying to make
      their way without a map.

    Title : Leaving the Catacombs
    Text : >-
      With the sarcophagus secure, the party can make their way back through
      the catacombs to either the first or second level. Both levels have various
      connections to the rest of the network, and can attempt to navigate the
      passages to a different, possibly blocked catacomb entrance.


      With Yrvyn's instructions, it should be relatively straightforward to chart
      a path to one of the hidden exits within the Outer Enclaves, giving the party
      a large advantage in retrieving the Demon Core. The remaining hidden exits
      are all inside older, sometimes abandoned temples, and have merely been
      plastered over. 


      If the party has no instructions, the catacombs are treacherous to navigate,
      requiring a DC 30 Survival check to avoid getting lost. A successful check
      brings the party to one of the Outer Enclave exits, but a failed check returns
      them to one of the six Royal Enclaves entrances:

      **Rock of Cashel**


      The palace grounds exit is located within the inner courtyard's chapel,
      hidden behind a false wall that can be rotated out of the way in the choir.
      The palace has a large number of servants and soldiers, and is the most
      difficult exit to use. Avoiding the Templar patrols requires a DC 25 Dexterity
      (Stealth) check every 10 minutes (DC 20 at night). The chapel is fortunately
      not too distant from the walls which lead to the Draseotheoa's enclave.


      **Crown Offices**


      The catacombs exit in the Crown Offices in the abbey next to the Chancellor's
      Office. During the day, the Crown Offices are a bustling administrative center,
      making it nearly impossible to avoid being seen, but at night there is only the
      occasional Templar patrol, and even more rarely, a clerk burning the midnight oil.


      **Kilmainham Gaol**


      The altar in the jail's chapel slides out of the way to reveal an entrance to
      the catacombs, but requires a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock.
      The chapel is located in the back courtyard, and is usually empty. Unfortunately,
      the jail is surrounded by a moat, with the main jail entrance the only bridge to
      the rest of the enclave.


      **Cloughoughter Cathedral**


      While not as famous as the Draseotheoa, the Cloughoughter Cathedral serves as
      the Primate's seat, and doubles as the Cult's administrative center. The catacomb
      exit is located in the chapterhouse that has become the Blackpoint Cult's
      assembly. This room is generally deserted, but is the farthest room from the
      cathedral entrance.


      **Caherminnaun Dun**


      A fortification outside the Crown Palace, the Caherminnaun Dun is the primary base
      of the Dusk Templars. The catacombs exit directly into the abbey within the
      training grounds, and is the only non-hidden entrance. A simple locked gate
      prevents access to the catacombs, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
      check to open. The training grounds are almost never empty, with usually a dozen
      or so Templar squires practicing under the watchful eye of at least two
      Templar Knights.

      Of over a hundred exits in the Outer Enclaves, only four are still usable as an exit,
      as they were merely plastered over rather than collapsed or filled in.
      A DC 13 Strength check can be used to break through the plaster,
      or alternatively, the plaster wall has AC 11 and 100 hp. The party will then
      emerge in either a chapterhouse or a choir.


      If the party is following Yrvyn's directions, they should find themselves at
      Mél of Ardagh, one of the oldest temples still in use. Otherwise, they will
      emerge randomly at one of the four plastered exits.
