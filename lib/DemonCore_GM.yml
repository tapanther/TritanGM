title : The Demon Core
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    Trapped within the golden mirror is the soul of an ancient and terrible
    demon. Where the Shroud provides the initial energy to the weapon, it is
    the Demon Core that empowers the truly apocalyptic devastation the weapon
    wreaks.


    The Demon Core, like all pieces of the weapon, was separated and hidden by
    Hermes Trismegistus prior to the Great Sack. Unbeknownst to anyone outside
    Hermes' inner circle, the Demon Core was not buried in a desolate area, but
    was instead entrusted into the care of Lord Symnyr Lynch, Councillor of
    Blackpoint and a long-time personal friend.


    As prolongued exposure to the Core is extremely hazardous, the sphere
    was placed inside a leaden sarcophagus, and hidden deep within the
    catacombs under the city. Since then, the existence of the Demon Core and
    its final resting place has been a closely guarded secret, known only
    to the office of the Blackpoint Councillor, and after the Great Sack,
    the Royal Chancellor that superseded the title.


    Discovering the location of the Demon Core's sarcophagus is no easy task.
    The catacombs are a twisting maze of passages and chambers, many of which
    have not been accessed in centuries. Many of the catacomb entrances were
    sealed during the Great Sack, and the rest are heavily guarded by the
    Dusk Templars. Breaking into the catacombs will be a difficult proposition,
    second only to breaking out with the sarcophagus.


    Alternatively, a diplomatic approach may be possible. The current
    Chancellor, Lord Reynfred, has been searching for information about the
    weapon, as have his predecessors. Although the Chancellor would use the
    weapon for his own purposes, the Lynch family remains the unofficial
    protectors of the Demon Core. Yrvyn Lynch serves as the Chancellor's
    clerk, has access to his ancestor's records, and has been looking for a way
    to secure the Demon Core from the Chancellor's grasp.

    Title : Reaching Blackpoint
    Subtitle : The Black Highway
    Text : >-
      Blackpoint lies at the Southwestern terminus of the Black Highway, the
      largest trade route in Easter Tritan, connecting the two capitals of
      Blackpoint and Siddar City. The road is wide, well maiantained, and
      most importantly, safe. The road is constantly patrolled by the Dusk
      Templars up until the Republic takes over some distance past Ravenhelm.


      The road passes through several small towns, but none are particularly
      worthy of note. Many of the towns have little to offer other than simple
      agricultural products and raw materials. As the towns get closer to
      Blackpoint, the attitude becomes colder and less receptive. The small
      villages just outside the city practically stare down any outsiders that
      wander through.

    Subtitle : The Gates of Blackpoint
    Text : >-
      As Blackpoint is composed of interlocking walled enclaves, the outer gates
      of the city are but the first of many checkpoints the party will need to
      pass in order to get access to the city proper.


      There are a dozen or so outer gates open at any given time, but only four
      have a customs station where non-citizens can gain the paperwork
      necessary to traverse through the city. These four gates are located on
      enclaves that were destroyed during the Great Sack, and still show much
      of the damage today.

    separate : False
    Subtitle : The Inns
    Text : >-
      Near each of the main four gates is a small inn, where visitors to the
      city can spend the night and get some rest from the long journey. Unlike
      the nearby villages, these inns depend entirely on foreign visitors, and
      extend them every courtesy.

      
      The innkeepers vary, but they are all pleasant and charming, a stark
      contrast to the surrounding villagers. Typical names for the innkeepers
      are Sean, Anraoi, Paidi, Eithne, Aibell, or Eimear. A short conversation
      with the inkeepers reveals that the entrances to the city are limited
      for foreigners, and few are allowed in without prior business in the
      city.


      A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check with the inkeeper can reveal some
      useful information to enter the city with fewer complications.
      Alternatively, a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check of the
      inn's patrons may reveal similar information.
    Table :
      15 : >-
        The inkeeper knows a merchant willing to pretend they are part of his
        security escort - for a price (1000 gp). He will take the party as far
        as the first enclave where his destination lies.
      18 : >-
        The inkeeper knows that one of the Crown inspectors (Sioda) at the 
        Station has a sick daughter, and may be willing to look the other way
        in exchange for some money for medicine (500 gp). The inspector will
        furnish the party with temporary entry permits, good for a pair of days.
      20 : >-
        The inkeeper reveals that one of the patrons has been selling forged
        entry permits (250 gp). The forgeries will withstand a moderate degree
        of scrutiny, but should provide access to the inner city.

    Subtitle : The Customs Station
    Text : >-
      The Customs Stations are only open between sunrise and sunset. Any
      travelers arriving outside those hours are directed by the guards
      on duty to one of the nearby inns.


      Once it is daytime, the Customs Station is open, and the guards will
      usher everyone without a valid entry permit into the small guardhouse
      where the inspector is located.

            A bookish inspector, he is interested in hearing tales of faraway lands.

            A bitter inspector, Sioda takes no joy in his job, and appears to be
            very distracted during the inspection. A DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check
            reveals that his daughter is sick, and he needs money for medicine
            (500gp).

      Without some additional help through the checkpoint, the party will
      be required to leave their weapons at the Customs Station, to be
      retrieved upon exit. Only licensed caravan guards to known merchants
      are allowed to keep their weapons. The gate is guarded by about 15
      soldiers, with dozens of Dusk Templars only moments away. Trying to
      break through the checkpoint will throw the enclave into lockdown, and
      immediately make the party wanted enemies of the Dohlaran Crown. This will
      make it much harder to avoid detection and can introduc complications
      once inside the city.


      Additionally, ancient magic items
      are expressly forbidden, and will be confiscated and not returned
      if discovered. This information is common knowledge, and the party
      should take care not to have such items on their person. In the interests
      of greater diplomacy, the inspectors will remind the party of this fact
      and allow them to come back another day when they are better prepared.
      

      The insspector on duty will thoroughly check the party, requiring a
      DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check
      for each party member attempting to smuggle a weapon through. If caught,
      the weapon(s) will be removed and placed in the depository. Should a
      member of the party attempt to smuggle a weapon through again, the
      entire party will have their passes revoked, and will need to try again
      in about a week's time.

    Title : Inside the Outer Enclaves
    Text : >-
      The outermost enclaves of the city were almost entirely destroyed
      by Baltatrax during the Great Sack. Many of the buildings are
      significantly newer and of a different architecture than those inside
      the inner city. The outer enclaves tend to be a mix of poorer housing
      and industries. Many merchants have supply contracts here, and
      accomodations and supplies may be easily found.



      Travel between the outer enclaves is not restricted, and permits are
      rarely checked. These enclaves are typically run by the local nobility,
      who are less willing to spend more than is necessary on security, and
      there are plenty of warehouses and shanties to hide in should the need
      arise.

    Subtitle : Gardhynyr Trade House
    Text : >-
      The Gahrdynyr Trade House, one of the major trading organizations
      within the Republic, has a major depot here. If the party has good
      relations with the Republic, they may have been gifted a letter of
      introduction, or even a Republic Warrant, which can be presented
      to the intendant at the Gardhynyr Trade House, Orval Morrissy.


      The intendant doesn't officially run the trade house, but he has
      the most up to date and accurante information, as he is the primary
      contact for merchants and local businessmen. A DC 15 Charisma
      (Persuasion) check can gain the party a lot of valuable information
      about the city, including the local layout. With a suitable introduction,
      the intendant will be much more forthcoming, allowing the party to roll
      with advantage. A warrant grants automatic success, as the intendant
      is entirely loyal to the Republic.


      The intendant can supply the party with additional paperwork to allow
      them easier travel into the inner city. The paperwork identifies
      the party as trade representatives, and for all intents and purposes
      is genuine. Without a warrant, the intendant will want some form of
      compensation for the paperwork, but he is not interested in money.
      He wants a magic item, forbidden contraband within the city, and he's
      not too particular about what he gets.


      If the party may not have a magic item they are willing to part with,
      the intendant knows of some confiscated items at a local guardhouse
      that haven't been logged yet. It seems a merchant was foolish enough
      to attempt to hide the items, and was promptly discovered.

    Subtitle : The Guardhouse
    Text : >-
      The guardhouse is located within the commercial zone, and is normally
      staffed by 20 guards, although many more can be called in case of
      an emergency. The guards mostly handle petty crimes, and don't suspect
      any kind of trouble will arise.


      At the depository of the guardhouse is a small trove of about a half
      dozen minor magic items, any of which will satisfy the intendant.

    Text : |
      To get to the depository, the party will need to:
        
      - Sneak into the guardhouse ...
        - ... during the day   : DC 25 Dexterity (Stealth) check
        - ... during the night : DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check
        - Getting a layout of the guardhouse and guard rotations with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can grant advantage.
      - Distract the guard at the repository entrance
      - Unlock the depository where the items are held with a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
        - The depository guard has a set of keys, which can be lifted with a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
