title : The Hand of God
GeneralInfo :
  Description : >-
    To the far South of the continent lay the shattered spires of the Broken Gate, the former Imperial Capital and
    the site of the downfall of First Age society. Though the ruins are rich in First Age artefacts and relics, few are
    foolhardy enough to attempt an expedition to the ancient capital, and fewer still return to tell the tales. Hordes
    of monsters and beasts claim the city ruins as their own, and have carved out their own warring domains within the
    walls. Until now, the different factions have been at a detente, eyeing one another warily from a distance, but
    news of an ancient relic threaten to destabilize the careful balance of power. *The Hand of God*, one of five
    parts of a terrible weapon discovered by the Alchemist, lies hidden within the city. Most troubling of all, rather
    than devolving into a free-for-all, the various monstrous factions have made diplomatic overtures to one another, a
    collaboration not seen since the Demogorgon's rampage six centuries earlier.

    Title : Reaching the Broken Gate
    Subtitle : By Land or By Sea
    Text : >-
      The Broken Gate is located along the Southern Coast of the continent, at the mouth of an artificial river known
      as the Lion's Tail. While it can be reached by either land or sea, both options present various hazards.

      By land, the great distance through the monster-infested provinces and the natural barrier formed by the
      Nonewallow are enough to discourage all but the most resilient of explorers. Without towns or cities to rest,
      the months-long expedition will be a battle of attrition, wearing away at the group's resources and personnel.

      By sea, the journey is far quicker, taking only about a week from major ports, but no less dangerous. Pirates and
      raiders patrol the sea, looking to score a quick haul from an unsuspecting merchant vessel that strays too close
      to the shores. Furthermore, the group risks being stranded, as the city's docks are no safe harbour. New ships
      are bound to attract the wrong sort of attention, and explorers might soon discover that their passage quickly
      becomes a one-way trip.
