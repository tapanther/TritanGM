<hr />
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The Stonhyr Express is the premier rail service between Siddar City and Blackpoint at the tail end of the 8th Century AGS. The line is operated by the International Company of Sleeping Cars, I.C.S.C., by license of the Trans-Siddar Railroad, the Republic's semi-public rail corporation.</p>
<p>This module focuses on a particularly unfortunate trip on the Sixth Day before the Ides of the Twelfth Moon of the Year 795 AGS (6IDE 3M 795Y). The Express, delayed due to a higher-precedence military rail convoy, is caught in a terrible blizzard West of Featherfurth, and derails on a snowbank. The following morning, two murders are discovered in the First Class sleeping car. What looks like an argument over gambling debts gone bad is quickly revealed as a double homicide, and with the blizzard raging, the killer must still be onboard.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>A former detective for the Siddar City Gendarmerie, Cochran was an early investor in the burgeoning railways of the Republic, making him fantastically wealthy. After his forced retirement, Cochran founded the International Company of Sleeping Cars with a group of investors, spurred by the dream of luxurious rail travel.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>The I.C.S.C. Board has threatened to remove Cochran from the directorship if the company stock misses yet another earnings forecast. The news of an unsolved pair of murders on the train would be disastrous for public perception in the company.</p>
<p><em>Alibi</em></p>
<p>Cochran's dominant hand has no strength due to an accident during his days at the Gendarmerie. Additionally, he was with Mat Stoker and the engineers in the locomotive at the time of the crimes.</p>
<p><em>Notable</em></p>
<p>Silver Gray suit bearing the company lapel pin. Right hand doesn't clench. Right Handed, but learned to use Left.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Testimony</p>
<p>I was in the engine the entire time. As soon as the train struck
the snowbank, I knew it would be trouble. After 30 years in the
service you can just tell the difference between an hours-long
delay and a days-long delay.</p>
<p>Conductors Stoker and Wright came with me, the engineers will
vouch for all of us. We were there until well past 1:00 AM.
Stoker left temporarily to announce the delay to the passengers,
but he returned within minutes.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>A veteran of the recent Western Conflicts, Col. Labey holds an automatic distrust bordering on outright xenophobia of foreigners. Dohlarans are only barely a step above the Western savages in his book. He was Katherine Rand's former superior officer during her youth in the military.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>He is deeply in love with Ms. Rand, and has been secretly seeing her despite the risks to both (he was never implicated in the scandal that kicked her out of the Army, but could stand court martial for hiding it ever since).</p>
<p><em>Alibi</em></p>
<p>He was with Lette all throughout the night of the crime, beyond Pinkerton's suite.</p>
<p><em>Notable</em></p>
<p>He wears an Army dress uniform. Left Handed</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Testimony</p>
<p>I was with Mr. Lette all night, discussing his blatantly absurd ideas
until well past 3 in the morning. The cabin door was ajar all night,
several passengers and the occasional conductor passed by.</p>
<p>I believe Ms. Gibb rushed by around 12:30 AM, sometime just before
Conductor Stoker returned to announce the derailment.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>A strict governess, Katherine has tried to escape a sordid past as a dishonorably discharged draftee. She's relied on a new name and an adopted identity to ensure she can find jobs as a governess. She is trying to move westward where it is less likely she will be recognized and revealed.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>She was dishonorably discharged from the Army for getting romantically involved with a superior officer (Col. Labey), and failing to disclose his identity when investigated.</p>
<p><em>Alibi</em></p>
<p>She was beyond Pinkerton's suite at the time of the murders.</p>

<p>Noticeably clever, Shuts fown all talk of herself immediately. Right Handed.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>Luther Lette was a promising law student, but his excessive love for inebriating drinks caused the University to expell him. He has taken odd secretarial jobs ever since to make ends meet.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>Lette has been embezzling from Forbes for the past year, both out of greed and out of hatred, as he knows Forbes killed George Pabst on purpose.</p>
<p><em>Alibi</em></p>
<p>He was with Col. Labey all throughout the night of the murder.</p>

<p>Wears spectacles. A closer examination reveals they are very expensive. Right Handed</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Testimony</p>
<p>Colonel Labey and I had a discussion that went really late, or really
early depending on how you look at it. I think we finally finished our
bottles around 3:30 AM. I remember looking at my timepiece and thinking
Mr. Forbes is going to kill me for showing up hung over. Guess I had the
right idea but the wrong victim.</p>
<p>I think I saw Ms. Gibb shortly before and after Stoker walked by.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>
<p>The son of a decorated Gendarme Detective, Merl decided at an early age not to follow directly in his father's gootsteps, and instead launched an early form of the private detective agency. He is well known among the Gendarme as an expert sleuth, but has managed to keep his name relatively well hidden from the general consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>Pinkerton is secretly working for Forbes, both as hired security as well as to help Forbes discover who has been stealing from him. He suspects Lette, but has not confronted the Gnome.</p>
<p><em>Alibi</em></p>
<p>He was hired to protect Forbes. He stood guard with Stoker after Georgina was "attacked", and Cochran will vouch for his good character.</p>
<p><em>Notable</em></p>
<p>Looks like the quintessential door-to-door salesman. Slight bulge in his jacket pocket from a lockpick set. Left Handed</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Testimony</p>
<p>I was on the lookout for anyone trying to access the first-class coach.
The only people I saw rushing back and forth were the Conductors, Ms. Gibb,
Mr. Owl, and Mrs. Mildred. The latter I stopped once it was clear something
fishy was going on. I lost track of the Kenku while I was standing guard
over Mrs. Pabst.</p>

<p>The owner of several smaller distilleries, Forbes' delivery cart accidentally killed George Pabst a little over a year ago. While tragic, the accident had the fortunate consequence that it gave Forbes an opportunity to meet, and later marry, Georgina Pabst and her not inconconsequential fortune and social status.</p>
<p><em>Secret</em></p>
<p>Forbes' real name is Cyril Weddal, a known racketeer and criminal. He murdered George Pabst in order to rid himself of a potential financial problem, and took advantage of his widow's grief to inject himself into her life and grant his cover businesses an air of respectability.</p>

<p>He was killed first.</p>

then I went right back. I think it was around 12:30 AM.</p>
<p>After that, I went back around 12:45 AM, and it wasn't until 1:10 AM that Mr.
Forbes accidentally rang for me. Then it was quiet until Mrs. Pabst had her

<h3 id="day-1-1030-pm-supper-service">Day 1, 10:30 PM - Supper Service</h3>
<p>Iris and Dr. Cochran sit together. Iris discusses her restlessness and lack of sleep aboard trains. Dr. Cochran gives her a sleeping draught. Lige sits with them.</p>
<p>MEP Learmonth and Elsa Gibb are absent. They are in the MEP's compartment. The MEP enjoys listening to Gibb read before going to bed.</p>
<p>Cochran sits alone, but welcomes company. He will discuss the company's past, and will answer any questions about the line or the company.</p>
<p>Pabst, Hays, and Forbes sit together. Pabst tells inane stories. Pabst will "kidnap" any player she fancies and forces them to dine with her. She reveals readily that she is on her first year anniversary, and that her previous husband was killed in an accident with Forbes' delivery wagon. She further reveals that Forbes came to call on her daily shortly after the accident, eventually leading to their marriage.</p>
<p>Lige and Forbes stare daggers at each other the entire supper from across separate tables.</p>
<p>Pinkerton is absent from dinner. He is inspecting Forbes' compartment while everyone is distracted. He will then do a run of the train to check for known faces in the other cars.</p>
<p>Lette and Dunn sit alone in silence. They will not offer much conversation.</p>
<p>Mat Stoker and Rush Wright will be transferring baggage to the baggage car as requested, and will otherwise return to their compartment during supper.</p>
<p>Forbes, Lette, and Dunn leave early to review earnings documents in Forbes' compartment.</p>
<p>Iris will leave early to discuss asylum with the MEP under the guise of a social visit.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-330-am-arrival-at-glacierheart">Day 2, 3:30 AM - Arrival at Glacierheart</h3>
<p>The following passengers board at this station:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Group 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Katherine Rand</li>
<li>Col. Isham Labey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Otis Uleaven</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Uleaven will accidentally hop in the wrong bunk and startle Dunn. They do not enjoy each other's company.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-830-am-breakfast-service">Day 2, 8:30 AM - Breakfast Service</h3>
<p>Iris and Pabst dine together, and bond over their shared love of the Republic's greater freedoms. They will shortly retire to the observation car to discuss their mutual marriage problems and concoct the murder plot. The women will make polite conversation, but will make it clear they wish to be alone.</p>
<p>Rand and Labey eat in tense silence across a pair of adjacent tables. They will not offer much conversation.</p>
<p>Coghill and Hays exchange medical stories, with the former starting to get the hang of deciphering the latter's sounds into something resembling speech.</p>
<p>Pinkerton searches Uleaven's quarters with Dunn, as both suspect that the Half-Orc is clearly a hired goon in a ridiculous disguise. They will find nothing.</p>
<p>Uleaven tries to rope Lige into a joint business venture, but the latter will tersely decline, citing the impropriety of it. Uleaven will finish breakfast with Cochran if possible, discussing their shared admiration of the wonders of steam.</p>
<p>Lette and Forbes will pour over financial records all throughout breakfast.</p>
<p>MEP Learmonth and Gibbs will eat together, with the latter ordering complicated special requests. The MEP and Gibbs will discuss the Blackpoint situation and the upcoming General Election.</p>
<p>Stoker and Wright are off duty during breakfast.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-1130-am-arrival-at-featherfurth">Day 2, 11:30 AM - Arrival at Featherfurth</h3>
<p>If the players look like they are having trouble, or aren't in a good position to unravel the mystery, the following passenger can board at this station:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hercules Parrót</li>
</ul>
<p>He is a celebrated actor who often portrays detectives. He is a tool for the GM to point the party in a particular direction, either by actually helping or by being so clearly incompetent that nothing he says can possibly be accurate, thereby steering the party away from a particular fruitless line.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-1230-pm-lunch-service">Day 2, 12:30 PM - Lunch Service</h3>
<p>Iris and MEP Learmonth sit together and discuss the Republic. Gibb sits with them but doesn't contribute much.</p>
<p>Rand, Hays, and Cochran are held hostage to Mrs. Pabst's conversation.</p>
<p>Forbes and Lette take a break. Forbes and Dunn dine in silence. Lette joins Lige and Labey.</p>
<p>Uleaven leaves early, complaining of abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Coghill will follow him shortly after summoning Stoker to fetch his medical kit.</p>
<p>Lige and Labey have an argument, causing Lige to storm off. The argument is spurred by the two parties' drasticly different interpretation of the "natural order". Lette and Labey hit it off pretty well, despite some disagreements.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-500-pm-delay">Day 2, 5:00 PM - Delay</h3>
<p>At a signal junction, the Express is sidelined to make way for a barging troop transport. The junction flags indicate that there has been a monster attack down the line, and military necessities trump passanger services.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-530-pm-dinner-service">Day 2, 5:30 PM - Dinner Service</h3>
<p>The Express is still sidelined until the line is cleared.</p>
<p>Forbes and Pabst dine with Lige and Iris. They have a hushed conversation where Lige and Forbes agree to meet at around 1:30 AM to settle the outstanding gambling debts.</p>
<p>MEP Learmonth and Dr. Coghill dine, and discuss their shared interest in Iris' wellbeing, albeit in polite and hushed tones so as not to be overheard.</p>
<p>Uleaven is missing. Stoker and Coghill will affirm that Uleaven is sick and resting in his berth.</p>
<p>Rand and Labey are in the observation car, pretending not to know one another while carrying on a tense conversation. They are not doing a good job of pretending.</p>
<p>Lette and Dunn dine in silence.</p>
<p>Cochran, Stoker, and Wright are in the baggage car with the other conductors, discussing the delay and how it will impact the train's timetable.</p>
<p>Hays dines alone, but she seems unfazed by it.</p>
<p>Pinkerton is absent, as it is becoming increasingly common. He is searching Lette's room, and has found evidence that it is Letter that is stealing from Forbes. He also finds evidence that Forbes killed George Pabst over a business dispute. He will not reveal his findings to Forbes, as he needs time to decide whether he's working for the right person or not.</p>
<p>Forbes, Lette, and Dunn will stay in the Restaurant car until suppertime, going over paperwork.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-700-pm-all-clear">Day 2, 7:00 PM - All Clear</h3>
<p>The flags are updated as the line is finally cleared. The Express resumes its journey. Cochran has ordered the engineers to try to make up time, and open up the throttle.</p>
<p>The weather has taken a turn for the worse though, and a heavy blizzard is descending upon the area. Stoker and Wright inform the passengers of the new timetable, and offer some complimentary hot drinks.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-1030-pm-supper-service">Day 2, 10:30 PM - Supper Service</h3>
<p>Pabst and Hays are missing. They are chatting in Hays' room, and snacking on some cheese and bread brought by Wright.</p>
<p>Lette, Dunn, and Forbes continue to go over documents.</p>
<p>Learmonth and Iris sit at a far table and discuss the mechanisms of asylumn in general terms.</p>
<p>Rand and Labey share a light snack in the observation car. They haven't left since dinner.</p>
<p>Pinkerton pays Uleaven a visit to try to pump him for information under the guise of a friendly visit. He discounts the sick Half-Orc as a threat, and gives him some contacts that could be useful in Blackpoint as an apology for wasting his time.</p>
<p>Coghill retrieves a new batch of sleeping draughts from his private locker in the baggage car. He visibly takes one before leaving the restaurant car, but if asked  will claim to have had a headache. Back at the He also hands one vial to Stoker and asks him to deliver it to Iris later that evening when she retires.</p>
<p>Lige is in his room, fuming.</p>
<p>Cochran is making the rounds along the train, thanking all the passengers for their patience and offering apologies for the delay.</p>
<p>Forbes orders a coffee to be brought to him at 11:30 PM, to his compartment.</p>
<h3 id="day-2-1120-pm-the-plot-is-executed">Day 2, 11:20 PM - The Plot is Executed</h3>
<p>Iris will leave early, and receive the draught from Stoker. She asks him to bring her some water, and while he is gone, swaps the draught with a placebo. She drinks the fake potion in front of him when he returns.</p>
<p>Pabst will return to her compartment before the end of supper, where she picks up a draught Iris left in the end priv. She returns to the restaurant car and orders a warm milk, and while the attendant is distracted, spikes the readied coffee for Forbes. If for some reason she is caught, she will claim that she is only doing it to make sure Forbes gets some sleep, as he has been staying up all night to go over paperwork.</p>
<p>Stoker picks up the coffee and delivers it not a few moments later. Forbes will quickly down the cup and notice nothing.</p>
<p>Lette and Dunn will be dismissed by Forbes as the latter wants some privacy to review some of the less-than-legal business books. He will quickly find himself overcome with exhaustion, but given his lack of sleep recently he won't find it too suspicious. He'll decide to take a short nap as the sleeping draught hits him.</p>
<p>On his way back, Lette runs into Labey and Rand, who are returning from the Observation Car. Lette invites Labey to discuss politics. The dragonborn accepts and bids Rand a polite goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="day-3-1200-am-the-express-derails">Day 3, 12:00 AM - The Express Derails</h3>
<p>As the blizzard rages on, the Express hits a snowbank that has built up on the rails. Although the snow gives, it lifts and halts the train, causing the engine to derail. The passengers will feel a harsh deceleration. Some people will receive minor bumps and bruises, and a few will get more serious injuries, often from falling or being struck by a heavy object knocked loose.</p>
<p>Stoker and Wright will check on the passengers in the cars, and being making announcements of another delay while the state of the Express is examined. Before Stoker heads to the locomotive, MEP Learmonth will summon him, and ask him to fetch Gibb. He wakes her and transmits the message before heading to the engine at 12:15 AM with Cochran.</p>
<p>Wright heads to the other passenger cars to take over for a conductor who was struck by a heavy suitcase and needs to rest.</p>
<h3 id="day-3-1225-am-the-first-murder">Day 3, 12:25 AM - The First Murder</h3>
<p>Iris uses her minor magical training to disguise herself as Stoker, and dons a stolen Conductor's uniform. She accidentally bumps into Gibb as the latter reports to Learmonth's cabin.</p>
<p>At 12:25 AM, Stoker returns from the locomotive and announces that the train has derailed. He announces it to the various compartments, and excuses himself to continue assessing the damage.</p>
<p>Going through the connecting door in Pabst's room, Iris enters Forbes' compartment, and finds him unconscious. She stabs Forbes several times at 12:26 AM. She opens the window, hoping to confuse the investigation. She then takes the knife with her after wiping it down to return to her compartment.</p>
<p>At 12:28 AM, she crosses the connecting door again and leaves. She returns to her compartment after hiding the stolen uniform in an empty compartment (only if Hercules Parrót is not aboard, otherwise she will hide the uniform in Gibb's room).</p>
<h3 id="day-3-105-am-the-second-murder">Day 3, 1:05 AM - The Second Murder</h3>
<p>Lige leaves his room to talk to Forbes and settle the debts. He slips into the dark cabin, and discovers the body when he opens the Ichor lamp shutters. He knows that he will be implicated, and decides to steal and destroy any evidence of his debt before leaving.</p>
<p>At 1:10 AM, Stoker accidentally rings the conductor's bell. Stoker, who had recently returned, answers, but is told by Lige (pretending to be Forbes) it was a mistake.</p>
<p>At 1:26 AM, Lige accidentally triggers a Glyph of Warding, which activates a Scorching Ray spell that kills him.</p>
<p>At 1:30 AM, after hearing the Glyph go off, Pabst frantically rings the bell, claiming that she felt a man in her compartment. Stoker attempts to calm her down, and tries to fetch Dr. Coghill without success (the Dr. is knocked out by his sleeping draught). Pinkerton notices the worried conductor, and joins him to stand guard outside Mrs. Pabst's door until morning.</p>
<h3 id="day-3-900-am-the-discovery">Day 3, 9:00 AM - The Discovery</h3>
<p>When Lette and Dunn are unable to rouse Forbes for breakfast, they fetch Stoker Cochran, and Coghill, and use the Conductor's key to open the compartment. They are shocked to discover the two bodies, and the investigation begins.</p>
